## Getting started

The Go SDK runs on your server, on Go 1.21 or later.

To send your first event, create a client with your project token and host from your [project settings](https://app.posthog.com/project/settings), then call `Enqueue` with a `Capture`.

The client queues events and sends them in batches, so call `Close` before your program exits, or the last events are lost.

Install the module (Go 1.21 or later):

```bash
go get github.com/posthog/posthog-go/v2
```

Create a client with your project API key, send an event, and close the client to flush the queue:

```go
package main

import "github.com/posthog/posthog-go/v2"

func main() {
	client, _ := posthog.NewWithConfig("<ph_project_api_key>", posthog.Config{
		Endpoint: "<ph_client_api_host>",
	})
	defer client.Close() // flushes queued events

	client.Enqueue(posthog.Capture{
		DistinctId: "user_123",
		Event:      "button_clicked",
		Properties: posthog.NewProperties().Set("plan", "pro"),
	})
}
```

## Setup

### `Config`

```go
type Config struct {
	// Endpoint is the PostHog API host used for event ingestion and feature flag requests.
	// If empty, it defaults to DefaultEndpoint.
	Endpoint string

	// SecretKey is the credential used to fetch local feature flag definitions,
	// remote config payloads, and lower-latency flag APIs. It accepts either a Personal
	// API Key (phx_...) or a Project Secret API Key (phs_...). Local evaluation can
	// also use definitions from FlagDefinitionCacheProvider without this key.
	// Without either, feature flag methods fall back to the /flags endpoint unless
	// the method requires local-only behavior. When both SecretKey and PersonalApiKey
	// are set, SecretKey takes precedence.
	// See https://posthog.com/docs/api/overview for how to create these keys.
	SecretKey string

	// PersonalApiKey is a deprecated alias for SecretKey. It is still honored for
	// backwards compatibility but SecretKey is preferred.
	//
	// Deprecated: use SecretKey instead.
	PersonalApiKey string

	// Disabled makes NewWithConfig return a client that sends nothing: its
	// methods return default values and ErrSDKDisabled. Use it in tests and
	// local development.
	Disabled bool

	// DisableGeoIP controls whether event and feature flag requests include
	// $geoip_disable/geoip_disable. Nil defaults to true because this SDK usually
	// runs server-side; set Ptr(false) to allow GeoIP lookup. On events it is a
	// default: a $geoip_disable value in the event, the RequestContext or
	// DefaultEventProperties wins.
	DisableGeoIP *bool

	// IsServer controls whether events include the $is_server property.
	//
	// Defaults to true: nil is treated as true because posthog-go usually runs
	// server-side, and $is_server lets PostHog identify server-side events.
	//
	// Set Ptr(false) when using posthog-go as a CLI or client so the event is
	// not flagged as server-side and the device OS is attributed normally. When
	// resolved to false, the SDK does not add $is_server. Like DisableGeoIP, it
	// is a default: a $is_server value in the event, the RequestContext or
	// DefaultEventProperties wins.
	//
	//	// CLI/client usage
	//	config := posthog.Config{IsServer: posthog.Ptr(false)}
	IsServer *bool

	// Interval is the flush interval for queued messages. Messages are sent when
	// BatchSize is reached or when this timer fires. If zero, it defaults to
	// DefaultInterval.
	Interval time.Duration

	// DefaultFeatureFlagsPollingInterval is the interval for reloading local feature
	// flag definitions when SecretKey or FlagDefinitionCacheProvider is configured.
	// If zero, it defaults to
	// DefaultFeatureFlagsPollingInterval.
	DefaultFeatureFlagsPollingInterval time.Duration

	// FeatureFlagRequestTimeout is the timeout for feature flag and remote config
	// HTTP requests. If zero, it defaults to DefaultFeatureFlagRequestTimeout.
	// Use time.Duration values such as 3 * time.Second.
	FeatureFlagRequestTimeout time.Duration

	// FeatureFlagRequestMaxRetries is the maximum number of retries after a transient
	// network error on /flags requests. If nil, it defaults to 1. Set to 0 to disable.
	FeatureFlagRequestMaxRetries *int

	// NextFeatureFlagsPollingTick optionally calculates the next local feature flag
	// polling delay. When set, it overrides DefaultFeatureFlagsPollingInterval.
	NextFeatureFlagsPollingTick func() time.Duration

	// FlagDefinitionCacheProvider shares local evaluation flag definitions with other
	// SDK instances through an external cache. Without SecretKey, instances read
	// cached definitions for local evaluation without consulting the provider's
	// fetch decision or publishing. Fetching definitions from PostHog requires
	// SecretKey.
	// See https://posthog.com/docs/feature-flags/local-evaluation/distributed-environments
	// for guidance.
	//
	// EXPERIMENTAL: this API may change in a minor version bump.
	FlagDefinitionCacheProvider FlagDefinitionCacheProvider

	// HistoricalMigration marks captured batches as historical migration traffic.
	// See https://posthog.com/docs/migrate for migration guidance.
	HistoricalMigration bool

	// Transport is the HTTP transport used by the client. Set it to customize
	// low-level request behavior such as connection pooling or proxies. If nil,
	// the client uses a clone of http.DefaultTransport with SDK defaults.
	Transport http.RoundTripper

	// Logger receives informational, warning, and error messages from background
	// operations. If nil, the client logs to os.Stderr with the standard logger.
	Logger Logger

	// DefaultEventProperties are added to the event properties of every Capture,
	// Exception, Identify, Alias and GroupIdentify event. They are useful for
	// common metadata like service name or app version. They never go into the
	// $set or $group_set person and group properties.
	//
	// They fill in before BeforeSend, only for keys that the event and the
	// request context left unset. A key with a nil value counts as set. $set,
	// $set_once, $groups and $group_set fill one level deep when both values are
	// maps. BeforeSend sees the filled values and can change or remove them. On
	// Identify, Alias and GroupIdentify they fill EventProperties.
	DefaultEventProperties Properties

	// DefaultEventOptions are added to the options of every Capture, Exception,
	// Identify, Alias and GroupIdentify event, such as process_person_profile or
	// cookieless_mode. They never set process_person_profile on an
	// identify-style event; see Options.
	//
	// They fill in before BeforeSend, only for options that the event and the
	// request context left missing or nil. BeforeSend sees the filled options and
	// can change them. Set an option to false on the event to turn a default off.
	// They win over the personless default.
	DefaultEventOptions Options

	// Callback receives success or failure notifications for messages sent to the
	// PostHog capture API. The message for an Alias does not include its
	// EventProperties or the DefaultEventProperties filled into them.
	Callback Callback

	// BeforeSend is called after SDK enrichment and before messages are serialized.
	// Return the message to send a modified version, or nil to drop it.
	//
	// The hook sees the event's own values and the values filled from
	// RequestContext, DefaultEventProperties, DefaultEventOptions, the
	// process_person_profile option the SDK sets on identify-style and
	// personless events, and the SDK: $is_server, $geoip_disable, system
	// context and feature flag properties. The SDK fills only keys the caller
	// left unset. Its changes are final. To change an option, set it in Options.
	BeforeSend BeforeSendFunc

	// BatchSize is the maximum number of messages sent in one batch API call.
	// Messages are sent when BatchSize is reached or when Interval fires. If zero,
	// it defaults to DefaultBatchSize. MaxBatchBytes targets the combined event size.
	BatchSize int

	// MaxEventBytes optionally caps the serialized size of a single event. A
	// larger event is rejected through Callback.Failure with ErrMessageTooBig
	// rather than being sent. Zero disables the SDK's per-event cap. Backend
	// request limits still apply; events processed within those limits can be
	// rejected individually.
	MaxEventBytes int

	// MaxBatchBytes bounds the combined serialized size of the events in one
	// capture request, independently of BatchSize, which bounds event count. A
	// batch is flushed early when the next event would exceed it. The request
	// envelope adds a small fixed overhead on top, so it is a target rather than
	// a hard wire limit. An event larger than MaxBatchBytes is sent alone.
	// When MaxEventBytes is set, MaxBatchBytes must be at least MaxEventBytes.
	// If zero, it defaults to DefaultMaxBatchBytes.
	MaxBatchBytes int

	// CaptureAICompression selects the compression mode for EnqueueAI request
	// bodies, independently of Compression. If zero, AI bodies are sent
	// uncompressed. CompressionZstd is a good choice: AI events are large JSON.
	CaptureAICompression CompressionMode

	// CaptureAIBatchUploadTimeout is the timeout for uploading one AI batch. AI
	// events are far larger than analytics events, so the lane gets its own
	// budget. If zero, it defaults to DefaultCaptureAIBatchUploadTimeout.
	CaptureAIBatchUploadTimeout time.Duration

	// CaptureAIMaxQueueSize is the maximum number of AI messages buffered in
	// memory. It is lower than MaxQueueSize by default because AI events can be
	// multi-megabyte, so the same count would pin far more memory. If zero, it
	// defaults to DefaultCaptureAIMaxQueueSize.
	CaptureAIMaxQueueSize int

	// MaxQueueSize is the maximum number of messages buffered in memory waiting to
	// be batched and sent. If zero, it defaults to DefaultMaxQueueSize. It is
	// clamped up to BatchSize so the queue can always hold at least one full batch.
	//
	// When the queue is full, Enqueue drops the newest message rather than blocking
	// the caller and returns ErrQueueFull (the drop is not reported via
	// Callback.Failure). Bulk or backfill workloads that enqueue faster than the
	// client can upload should check the error returned by Enqueue for ErrQueueFull
	// and throttle or retry (or raise MaxQueueSize), otherwise events are dropped,
	// not delayed.
	MaxQueueSize int

	// Verbose enables more frequent and detailed debug logging through Logger.
	Verbose bool

	// RetryAfter returns the delay before retrying a failed batch upload. The int
	// argument is the retry attempt number. If nil, the SDK uses DefaultBackoff's
	// policy (with ±25% jitter), capped at MaxRetryBackoff. A custom RetryAfter
	// is used as given, with no jitter added.
	RetryAfter func(int) time.Duration

	// MaxRetries is the maximum number of retries after the first send attempt.
	// It must be in [0,9]. If nil, it defaults to 3 retries (4 total attempts).
	MaxRetries *int

	// MaxRetryBackoff caps how long a single retry waits. It bounds the default
	// exponential backoff and clamps a server Retry-After to the same value, so
	// a large or hostile header cannot park a batch. If zero, it defaults to
	// DefaultMaxRetryBackoff. A custom RetryAfter is used as given.
	MaxRetryBackoff time.Duration

	// ShutdownTimeout is the maximum time Close waits for in-flight messages to be
	// sent. If zero or negative, Close waits indefinitely for backward compatibility.
	ShutdownTimeout time.Duration

	// BatchUploadTimeout is the timeout for uploading one batch to the capture
	// endpoint. If zero, it defaults to DefaultBatchUploadTimeout.
	BatchUploadTimeout time.Duration

	// BatchSubmitTimeout is the maximum time to wait when submitting a batch to the
	// worker pool while its queue is full. If zero, it defaults to
	// DefaultBatchSubmitTimeout. Set a negative duration for non-blocking behavior
	// that drops immediately when the queue is full.
	BatchSubmitTimeout time.Duration

	// MaxEnqueuedRequests is the maximum number of batches waiting for upload.
	// When the queue is full, new batches are dropped and the failure callback is
	// invoked. If zero, it defaults to DefaultMaxEnqueuedRequests.
	MaxEnqueuedRequests int

	// Compression selects the compression mode for batch payloads. CompressionGzip
	// compresses payloads and sets the matching Content-Encoding header. If zero,
	// it defaults to CompressionNone.
	Compression CompressionMode

	// AppHost is the PostHog app host that Client.Emails sends to, such as
	// https://posthog.example.com for a self-hosted instance. If empty, a
	// PostHog Cloud Endpoint maps to its region's app host, us.posthog.com or
	// eu.posthog.com. Any other Endpoint may be a reverse proxy for ingestion,
	// so email requests never go there: without AppHost, they fail with the
	// code missing_app_host. It must use https unless AllowInsecureAppHost is
	// set. When AppHost is set, every request that carries SecretKey goes to
	// it: email requests, flag definitions for local evaluation, and remote
	// config payloads. Without AppHost, flag requests use Endpoint.
	AppHost string

	// AllowInsecureAppHost lets Client.Emails send to an http AppHost, such as
	// http://localhost:8010 during local development. Email requests carry
	// SecretKey and the email itself, so over http both travel unencrypted.
	AllowInsecureAppHost bool

	// EmailRequestTimeout is the timeout of each Client.Emails request. If
	// zero, it defaults to DefaultEmailRequestTimeout.
	EmailRequestTimeout time.Duration

	// EmailRequestMaxRetries is the number of retries of a Client.Emails
	// request after its first attempt, 0 to 9. If nil, it defaults to
	// DefaultEmailRequestMaxRetries. Set Ptr(0) when a job runner already
	// retries the send, and pass an IdempotencyKey that names the email.
	EmailRequestMaxRetries *int

	// MigratedFrom names the email provider your sends moved from, such as
	// "resend". Client.Emails sends it as the X-PostHog-Migrated-From header.
	MigratedFrom string
}
```

Config carries configuration options used when constructing a Client with NewWithConfig.

Each exported field's zero value is either meaningful or replaced by the default documented on that field.

#### `Config.GetDisableGeoIP`

```go
func (c Config) GetDisableGeoIP() bool
```

GetDisableGeoIP instructs the client to set $geoip\_disable on event properties or feature flag requests. It is on by default as Go is mainly used on server side and to be compatible with posthog-python.

#### `Config.GetIsServer`

```go
func (c Config) GetIsServer() bool
```

GetIsServer reports whether events should include the $is\_server property. It is on by default because posthog-go is mainly used server-side; set Config.IsServer to Ptr(false) for CLI/client usage to omit $is\_server.

#### `Config.Validate`

```go
func (c *Config) Validate() error
```

Validate verifies that fields that don't have zero-values are set to valid values, returns an error describing the problem if a field was invalid.

### `posthog.New`

```go
func New(apiKey string) (Client, error)
```

New creates a Client with the default Config and the provided PostHog project API key.

The apiKey parameter is trimmed before use. A missing or personal API key gives a disabled client, as described on NewWithConfig.

### `posthog.NewWithConfig`

```go
func NewWithConfig(apiKey string, config Config) (cli Client, err error)
```

NewWithConfig creates a Client with the provided PostHog project API key and Config.

The apiKey, Config.Endpoint, Config.SecretKey, and Config.PersonalApiKey values are trimmed before use. It returns a ConfigError when config contains invalid values such as negative intervals or out-of-range retry settings; in that case the returned Client is nil.

A disabled client sends nothing; its methods return default values and ErrSDKDisabled. NewWithConfig returns one with a nil error when Config.Disabled is set, or when apiKey is empty or a personal API key (phx\_...). The last two log an error, so a missing key never stops the app.

## Capture

### `Capture`

```go
type Capture struct {
	// Type is reserved for SDK serialization and is overwritten by Enqueue.
	// Deprecated: PostHog ignores the top-level type field on capture events. Use Event for
	// the captured event name.
	Type string
	// Uuid is an optional event UUID. If empty, Enqueue generates a random UUID.
	// If set, it must be a valid UUID; invalid values are replaced with a generated UUID.
	// Set it only when you need idempotency, for example to prevent duplicate events.
	Uuid string
	// DistinctId identifies the user or entity that performed Event.
	// When using EnqueueWithContext, this can be inherited from RequestContext.
	DistinctId string
	// Event is the event name to capture. It must be non-empty.
	Event string
	// Timestamp is the event timestamp. UTC is preferred; non-UTC values are
	// converted to the equivalent UTC instant. If zero, Enqueue uses the current time.
	Timestamp time.Time
	// Properties are event properties. They win over request-context properties
	// and Config.DefaultEventProperties, which fill in before BeforeSend only for
	// keys missing here. A key with a nil value blocks the fill. $set, $set_once,
	// $groups and $group_set fill one level deep when both values are maps.
	Properties Properties
	// Groups associates the event with group analytics groups. They win key by
	// key over a $groups map in Properties.
	Groups Groups
	// Options are per-event capture options, sent unchanged. See Options. They
	// win over request-context options, Config.DefaultEventOptions and the
	// personless default, which fill in before BeforeSend only for options
	// missing or nil here. An identify-style Event, such as $identify,
	// defaults process_person_profile to true; see Options.
	Options Options
	// SendFeatureFlags requests legacy feature flag enrichment on this event.
	// Deprecated: Prefer Client.EvaluateFlags and pass the returned snapshot via Flags.
	// Flags writes the canonical $feature/<key> and $active_feature_flags properties.
	SendFeatureFlags SendFeatureFlagsValue
	// Flags, when set, attaches $feature/<key> and $active_feature_flags
	// properties from a snapshot returned by Client.EvaluateFlags. It is
	// preferred over SendFeatureFlags: the snapshot guarantees the event
	// carries the exact values the application branched on and avoids a
	// hidden /flags request on every capture. Flags takes precedence when
	// both are set.
	Flags *FeatureFlagEvaluations
	// IsServer reports whether the event sets $is_server. Enqueue sets it from
	// Config.GetIsServer, then from the $is_server value left after BeforeSend.
	// To change $is_server, set the property.
	IsServer bool
}
```

Capture represents a custom event to send to PostHog. Enqueue validates Event and DistinctId (or obtains DistinctId from request context), fills Type, Uuid, and Timestamp, fills request-context and default properties and options the event left unset, runs Config.BeforeSend, and queues the event for a future batch upload.

#### `Capture.APIfy`

```go
func (msg Capture) APIfy() APIMessage
```

APIfy converts a Capture message into the PostHog batch API representation.

#### `Capture.Validate`

```go
func (msg Capture) Validate() error
```

Validate checks that the capture message has a non-empty Event and DistinctId.

### `EnqueueClient.Enqueue`

```go
Enqueue(Message) error
```

Enqueue queues a message to be sent by the client when the conditions for a batch upload are met. This is the main method you'll be using, a typical flow would look like this:

```go
client, err := posthog.New(apiKey)
if err != nil {
    return err
}
...
client.Enqueue(posthog.Capture{ ... })
...
client.Close()
```

Enqueue returns an error if the message could not be queued, which happens when the client is closed, the message is invalid, or the in-memory queue is full (ErrQueueFull) -- in the latter case the message is dropped rather than blocking the caller. A full-queue drop is reported only through this returned error, not through Callback.Failure.

Bulk or backfill workloads that can enqueue faster than the client uploads should check the returned error for ErrQueueFull and throttle or retry (or raise Config.MaxQueueSize); otherwise events are dropped, not delayed.

### `posthog.EnqueueWithContext`

```go
func EnqueueWithContext(ctx context.Context, client EnqueueClient, msg Message) error
```

EnqueueWithContext queues a message and applies any PostHog request context attached to ctx. Use this from HTTP handlers with r.Context() when NewRequestContextMiddleware is installed.

## Identify

### `Identify`

```go
type Identify struct {
	// Type is reserved for SDK serialization and is overwritten by Enqueue.
	// Deprecated: this field is ignored by PostHog ingestion and is kept for backwards compatibility.
	Type string
	// Uuid is an optional event UUID. If empty, Enqueue generates a random UUID.
	// If set, it must be a valid UUID; invalid values are replaced with a generated UUID.
	Uuid string

	// DistinctId is the user distinct ID whose person profile should be updated.
	DistinctId string
	// Timestamp is the event timestamp. UTC is preferred; non-UTC values are
	// converted to the equivalent UTC instant. If zero, Enqueue uses the current time.
	Timestamp time.Time
	// Properties are sent as the $set person properties for DistinctId.
	Properties Properties
	// EventProperties are properties of the $identify event itself, not of the
	// person. Enqueue fills the keys they leave unset from the request context,
	// then from Config.DefaultEventProperties, before BeforeSend. A $set in them is merged
	// under Properties, which win key by key.
	EventProperties Properties
	// Options are per-event capture options, sent unchanged, except that
	// process_person_profile defaults to true. See Options.
	Options Options
	// DisableGeoIP reports whether the event sets $geoip_disable. Enqueue sets
	// it from Config.GetDisableGeoIP, then from the $geoip_disable value left
	// after BeforeSend. To change $geoip_disable, set the property.
	DisableGeoIP bool
	// IsServer reports whether the event sets $is_server. Enqueue sets it from
	// Config.GetIsServer, then from the $is_server value left after BeforeSend.
	// To change $is_server, set the property.
	IsServer bool
}
```

Identify represents an identify call that sets person properties for a user. Enqueue validates that DistinctId is set, fills Type, Uuid, Timestamp, and DisableGeoIP, then sends the message as a $identify event.

#### `Identify.APIfy`

```go
func (msg Identify) APIfy() APIMessage
```

APIfy converts an Identify message into the PostHog batch API representation.

#### `Identify.Validate`

```go
func (msg Identify) Validate() error
```

Validate checks that the identify message has a DistinctId.

## Alias

### `Alias`

```go
type Alias struct {
	// Type is reserved for SDK serialization and is overwritten by Enqueue.
	// Deprecated: this field is ignored by PostHog ingestion and is kept for backwards compatibility.
	Type string
	// Uuid is an optional event UUID. If empty, Enqueue generates a random UUID.
	// If set, it must be a valid UUID; invalid values are replaced with a generated UUID.
	Uuid string

	// Alias is the alternate distinct ID to attach to DistinctId.
	Alias string
	// DistinctId is the existing user distinct ID that Alias should resolve to.
	DistinctId string
	// Timestamp is the event timestamp. UTC is preferred; non-UTC values are
	// converted to the equivalent UTC instant. If zero, Enqueue uses the current time.
	Timestamp time.Time
	// EventProperties are properties of the $create_alias event. Enqueue fills
	// the keys they leave unset from the request context, then from
	// Config.DefaultEventProperties, before BeforeSend. The SDK's alias property wins over an "alias" key in them.
	// The Config.Callback message does not include them.
	EventProperties Properties
	// Options are per-event capture options, sent unchanged, except that
	// process_person_profile defaults to true. See Options.
	Options Options
	// DisableGeoIP reports whether the event sets $geoip_disable. Enqueue sets
	// it from Config.GetDisableGeoIP, then from the $geoip_disable value left
	// after BeforeSend. To change $geoip_disable, set the property.
	DisableGeoIP bool
	// IsServer reports whether the event sets $is_server. Enqueue sets it from
	// Config.GetIsServer, then from the $is_server value left after BeforeSend.
	// To change $is_server, set the property.
	IsServer bool
}
```

Alias represents an alias call that links another distinct ID to an existing user. Enqueue validates that DistinctId and Alias are both set, fills Type, Uuid, Timestamp, and DisableGeoIP, then sends the message as a $create\_alias event.

#### `Alias.APIfy`

```go
func (msg Alias) APIfy() APIMessage
```

APIfy converts an Alias message into the PostHog batch API representation.

#### `Alias.Validate`

```go
func (msg Alias) Validate() error
```

Validate checks that the alias message has both DistinctId and Alias set.

## Capture AI

### `Client.EnqueueAI`

```go
EnqueueAI(Message) error
```

EnqueueAI queues a message for PostHog's dedicated AI capture endpoint instead of the analytics one. Use it for LLM observability events ($ai\_generation, $ai\_span, $ai\_trace and the rest).

The two lanes are independent: the AI lane has its own queue, worker and retry state, so a multi-megabyte AI event cannot delay analytics events, and it is started on first use so clients that never call this pay nothing for it.

EnqueueAI performs no routing check of its own. The server decides whether an event belongs on this lane and reports the verdict per event, so a misrouted event comes back as a terminal drop through Callback.Failure rather than being rejected locally. Enqueue likewise never reroutes AI-named events to this lane.

It returns the same errors as Enqueue.

### `posthog.EnqueueAIWithContext`

```go
func EnqueueAIWithContext(ctx context.Context, client Client, msg Message) error
```

EnqueueAIWithContext queues a message for the dedicated AI capture endpoint and applies any PostHog request context attached to ctx. It is EnqueueWithContext for the AI lane, and takes the full Client because only a real client has an AI lane -- an AI event must never silently fall back to the analytics endpoint.

## Capture exception

### `Exception`

```go
type Exception struct {
	// Type is reserved for SDK serialization and is overwritten by Enqueue.
	// Deprecated: this field is ignored by PostHog ingestion and is kept for backwards compatibility.
	Type string
	// Uuid is an optional event UUID. If empty, Enqueue generates a random UUID.
	// If set, it must be a valid UUID; invalid values are replaced with a generated UUID.
	Uuid string

	// DistinctId identifies the user or entity associated with the exception.
	// When using EnqueueWithContext, this can be inherited from RequestContext.
	DistinctId string
	// DebugImages lists the binary images referenced by "native" stack
	// frames, sent as $debug_images for server-side symbolication.
	DebugImages []DebugImage
	// Timestamp is the event timestamp. UTC is preferred; non-UTC values are
	// converted to the equivalent UTC instant. If zero, Enqueue uses the current time.
	Timestamp time.Time
	// Properties are custom event properties flattened into the exception event.
	Properties Properties
	// Options are per-event capture options, sent unchanged. See Options.
	Options Options
	// DisableGeoIP reports whether the event sets $geoip_disable. Enqueue sets
	// it from Config.GetDisableGeoIP, then from the $geoip_disable value left
	// after BeforeSend. To change $geoip_disable, set the property.
	DisableGeoIP bool
	// IsServer reports whether the event sets $is_server. Enqueue sets it from
	// Config.GetIsServer, then from the $is_server value left after BeforeSend.
	// To change $is_server, set the property.
	IsServer bool

	// ExceptionList is the list of exception items sent as $exception_list. It must be non-empty.
	ExceptionList []ExceptionItem
	// ExceptionFingerprint optionally overrides PostHog's default exception grouping fingerprint.
	ExceptionFingerprint *string
}
```

Exception represents an error tracking exception event. Enqueue validates DistinctId and ExceptionList (or obtains DistinctId from request context), fills Type, Uuid, Timestamp, and DisableGeoIP, then sends the message as a $exception event.

#### `Exception.APIfy`

```go
func (msg Exception) APIfy() APIMessage
```

APIfy converts an Exception message into the PostHog batch API representation.

#### `Exception.Validate`

```go
func (msg Exception) Validate() error
```

Validate checks that the exception has a DistinctId and at least one valid ExceptionItem.

#### `posthog.NewDefaultException`

```go
func NewDefaultException(
	timestamp time.Time,
	distinctID, title, description string,
) Exception
```

NewDefaultException builds an Exception with a default stack trace.

The timestamp parameter becomes Exception.Timestamp; UTC is preferred, and Enqueue converts non-UTC values to the equivalent UTC instant. distinctID becomes Exception.DistinctId, title becomes the first ExceptionItem.Type, and description becomes the first ExceptionItem.Value. The returned Exception is ready to pass to Client.Enqueue. Build Exception manually if you need custom properties, fingerprints, mechanisms, or stack frames.

### `posthog.NewSlogCaptureHandler`

```go
func NewSlogCaptureHandler(next slog.Handler, client EnqueueClient, opts ...SlogOption) *SlogCaptureHandler
```

NewSlogCaptureHandler wraps next and mirrors qualifying slog records to PostHog.

The next parameter receives all records as your normal handler. The client parameter receives captured Exception messages. The opts parameters customize capture level, distinct ID resolution, stack traces, descriptions, fingerprints, and extra properties.

You typically wrap your existing handler:

```go
client, err := posthog.NewWithConfig(...)
// error handling and `defer client.Close()` call
base := slog.NewTextHandler(os.Stdout, &slog.HandlerOptions{Level: slog.LevelInfo})
logger := slog.New(posthog.NewSlogCaptureHandler(base, client,
  posthog.WithDistinctIDFn(func(ctx context.Context, r slog.Record) string {
    return "my-user-id" // or pull from ctx
  }),
))
```

## Emails

### `Client.Emails`

```go
Emails() Emails
```

Emails sends transactional email from PostHog email templates or from content your code rendered, and reads the status of each email it sent. It needs Config.SecretKey, a project secret API key with the transactional\_email:write scope. Close waits for email requests in flight, and a request after Close fails with the code client\_closed.

## Flush

### `Client.Flush`

```go
Flush() error
```

Flush sends queued messages and waits for the current delivery cycle without closing the client. It covers the AI lane once EnqueueAI has started it, and never starts that lane itself. Retryable failures end the cycle while the transport retains the events for its scheduled retry. Flush does not bypass retry backoff. Delivery failures use the existing retry policy and Callback.Failure; a nil result does not guarantee successful ingestion. Use FlushWithContext to bound the wait. Do not call a blocking Flush from a delivery callback, which is itself part of the delivery cycle.

### `Client.FlushWithContext`

```go
FlushWithContext(context.Context) error
```

FlushWithContext is Flush with a caller-controlled deadline. Cancellation stops only this caller's wait, not delivery or future use of the client. Messages accepted before the call are covered; concurrent Enqueue calls may be included in this cycle or a later one. Calls after Close return ErrClosed.

## Get feature flag

### `Client.GetFeatureFlag`

```go
GetFeatureFlag(FeatureFlagPayload) (interface{}, error)
```

GetFeatureFlag evaluates one feature flag for a user. It returns a variant string for multivariate flags, true or false for boolean flags, false with nil error when the flag is missing/disabled, and an error for evaluation failures. Deprecated: Prefer EvaluateFlags for new code.

## Get feature flag payload

### `Client.GetFeatureFlagPayload`

```go
GetFeatureFlagPayload(FeatureFlagPayload) (string, error)
```

GetFeatureFlagPayload returns the payload for the matching flag value, or an empty string when no payload is configured or the flag is missing/disabled. Deprecated: Use GetFeatureFlagResult instead, which returns both the flag value and payload while properly tracking feature flag usage.

## Get feature flag result

### `Client.GetFeatureFlagResult`

```go
GetFeatureFlagResult(FeatureFlagPayload) (*FeatureFlagResult, error)
```

GetFeatureFlagResult evaluates one feature flag and returns its value and payload together. Use this instead of calling GetFeatureFlag and GetFeatureFlagPayload separately. It returns ErrFlagNotFound when the flag cannot be found or evaluated and ErrNoSecretKey when OnlyEvaluateLocally is true without SecretKey or a FlagDefinitionCacheProvider.

## Get feature flags

### `Client.GetAllFlags`

```go
GetAllFlags(FeatureFlagPayloadNoKey) (map[string]interface{}, error)
```

GetAllFlags evaluates all flags for a user. Returned values are booleans for boolean flags and strings for multivariate variants. It returns ErrNoSecretKey when OnlyEvaluateLocally is true without SecretKey or a FlagDefinitionCacheProvider.

## Evaluate flags

### `Client.EvaluateFlags`

```go
EvaluateFlags(EvaluateFlagsPayload) (*FeatureFlagEvaluations, error)
```

EvaluateFlags returns a snapshot of feature-flag evaluations for the given distinct\_id using at most one /flags request. Returns ErrNoDistinctID if DistinctId is empty. Pass the returned snapshot to a Capture event via Capture.Flags to attach $feature/&lt;key> properties without another network call. Calls to IsEnabled and GetFlag on the snapshot fire deduped $feature\_flag\_called events; GetFlagPayload does not.

If FlagKeys contains a key missing from loaded local definitions, EvaluateFlags includes it in the remote /flags fallback unless OnlyEvaluateLocally is true. If the remote request fails after some flags were resolved locally, EvaluateFlags returns a non-nil snapshot containing the locally-evaluated flags alongside the error so the caller can still branch on what was resolved. If OnlyEvaluateLocally is true and neither SecretKey nor a FlagDefinitionCacheProvider is configured, returns ErrNoSecretKey.

### `EvaluateFlagsPayload`

```go
type EvaluateFlagsPayload struct {
	// DistinctId is the user distinct ID to evaluate flags for. It is required
	// unless EvaluateFlagsWithContext can read one from RequestContext.
	DistinctId string
	// DeviceId optionally provides a device_id for remote /flags requests and event deduplication.
	DeviceId *string
	// Groups supplies group identifiers for group-targeted flags.
	Groups Groups
	// PersonProperties overrides person properties used during flag evaluation.
	PersonProperties Properties
	// GroupProperties overrides group properties used during flag evaluation, keyed by group type.
	GroupProperties map[string]Properties
	// OnlyEvaluateLocally prevents fallback to remote /flags requests. Flags
	// that cannot be resolved from loaded local definitions are omitted, and
	// FeatureFlagEvaluations.UnresolvedFlags lists them with a reason.
	OnlyEvaluateLocally bool
	// DisableGeoIP, when non-nil, overrides the client-level DisableGeoIP for
	// this evaluation only.
	DisableGeoIP *bool
	// FlagKeys restricts local evaluation, the remote request, and the returned
	// snapshot to the named flags. Nil evaluates all flags, while an explicitly
	// empty slice returns an empty snapshot without evaluating flags. A requested
	// key missing from loaded local definitions triggers a /flags fallback unless
	// OnlyEvaluateLocally is true. EvaluateFlags does not cache snapshots, so a
	// key that does not exist remotely can trigger a request on each call.
	// Use FeatureFlagEvaluations.Only to filter an existing snapshot in memory.
	FlagKeys []string
}
```

EvaluateFlagsPayload is the input to Client.EvaluateFlags.

### `posthog.EvaluateFlagsWithContext`

```go
func EvaluateFlagsWithContext(ctx context.Context, client Client, payload EvaluateFlagsPayload) (*FeatureFlagEvaluations, error)
```

EvaluateFlagsWithContext evaluates feature flags and uses the request-scoped distinct ID attached to ctx when payload.DistinctId is empty. It does not generate personless IDs: feature flag evaluation requires a stable distinct ID and returns ErrNoDistinctID if neither payload nor ctx has one.

## Group identify

### `GroupIdentify`

```go
type GroupIdentify struct {
	// Type is the group type, such as "company" or "organization".
	Type string
	// Key is the group key or ID within the group type.
	Key string
	// Uuid is an optional event UUID. If empty, Enqueue generates a random UUID.
	// If set, it must be a valid UUID; invalid values are replaced with a generated UUID.
	Uuid string

	// DistinctId is the distinct ID the $groupidentify event is sent under. If
	// empty, Enqueue uses the request context's distinct ID, then
	// "$<Type>_<Key>".
	DistinctId string
	// Timestamp is the event timestamp. UTC is preferred; non-UTC values are
	// converted to the equivalent UTC instant. If zero, Enqueue uses the current time.
	Timestamp time.Time
	// Properties are sent as the $group_set properties for the group.
	Properties Properties
	// EventProperties are properties of the $groupidentify event itself, not of
	// the group. Enqueue fills the keys they leave unset from the request
	// context (except its session ID), then from Config.DefaultEventProperties,
	// before BeforeSend. A $group_set in them is
	// merged under Properties, which win key by key.
	EventProperties Properties
	// Options are per-event capture options, sent unchanged, except that
	// process_person_profile defaults to true. See Options.
	Options Options
	// DisableGeoIP reports whether the event sets $geoip_disable. Enqueue sets
	// it from Config.GetDisableGeoIP, then from the $geoip_disable value left
	// after BeforeSend. To change $geoip_disable, set the property.
	DisableGeoIP bool
	// IsServer reports whether the event sets $is_server. Enqueue sets it from
	// Config.GetIsServer, then from the $is_server value left after BeforeSend.
	// To change $is_server, set the property.
	IsServer bool
}
```

GroupIdentify represents a group analytics call that sets properties on a group. Enqueue validates Type and Key, fills Uuid, Timestamp, and DisableGeoIP, then sends the message as a $groupidentify event.

#### `GroupIdentify.APIfy`

```go
func (msg GroupIdentify) APIfy() APIMessage
```

APIfy converts a GroupIdentify message into the PostHog batch API representation.

#### `GroupIdentify.Validate`

```go
func (msg GroupIdentify) Validate() error
```

Validate checks that the group identify message has Type and Key set.

## Is feature enabled

### `Client.IsFeatureEnabled`

```go
IsFeatureEnabled(FeatureFlagPayload) (interface{}, error)
```

IsFeatureEnabled evaluates one feature flag for a user and returns the same value as GetFeatureFlag: a variant string for multivariate flags or a bool for boolean flags. The FeatureFlagPayload parameter supplies the flag key, distinct ID, optional groups/properties, and evaluation options. Deprecated: Prefer EvaluateFlags for new code.

## Reload feature flags

### `Client.ReloadFeatureFlags`

```go
ReloadFeatureFlags() error
```

ReloadFeatureFlags forces a reload of feature flags. If neither SecretKey nor a FlagDefinitionCacheProvider is configured, returns ErrNoSecretKey.

## Shutdown

### `Client.Close`

```go
Close() error
```

Close gracefully shuts down the client and flushes pending messages. If Config.ShutdownTimeout is positive, Close uses it as the shutdown deadline; otherwise it waits indefinitely. Repeated calls return ErrClosed.

### `Client.CloseWithContext`

```go
CloseWithContext(context.Context) error
```

CloseWithContext gracefully shuts down the client with the provided context. The context can be used to control the shutdown deadline.

## Before send hook

### `BeforeSendFunc`

```go
type BeforeSendFunc func(Message) Message
```

BeforeSendFunc is called before a message is converted to the PostHog API format. It can return a modified message, or nil to drop the message. If the hook panics, returns an invalid message, or returns a different message type, the message is dropped.

The SDK passes an isolated copy of SDK-owned mutable fields where practical: Properties, Groups and Options clone common JSON-like maps and slices, and Exception clones its exception list, stack traces, mechanisms, fingerprint, and debug images. Arbitrary reference values stored inside Properties, Groups or Options (for example, pointers or custom mutable structs held as interface{} values) are not deep-cloned and can still share state with the caller. Options is never nil inside the hook, so the hook can call Set directly.

## SDK utils

### `Client.GetRemoteConfigPayload`

```go
GetRemoteConfigPayload(string) (string, error)
```

GetRemoteConfigPayload returns the decrypted payload for a remote config flag key. It requires Config.SecretKey and returns ErrNoSecretKey when missing.

### `posthog.NewRequestContextMiddleware`

```go
func NewRequestContextMiddleware(next http.Handler, opts ...RequestContextOption) http.Handler
```

NewRequestContextMiddleware wraps an http.Handler with PostHog request-context extraction.

The middleware always attaches safe request metadata to r.Context(). By default it also reads X-PostHog-Distinct-Id and X-PostHog-Session-Id into request-scoped analytics context; WithCaptureTracingHeaders(false) turns that off. Use EnqueueWithContext(r.Context(), ...) for captures inside the request so this metadata is applied.

### `posthog.Ptr`

```go
func Ptr[T any](v T) *T
```

Ptr returns a pointer to v.

### `posthog.SimpleInAppDecider`

```go
func SimpleInAppDecider(frame runtime.Frame) bool
```

SimpleInAppDecider is a basic InAppDecider that classifies frames by file path. It excludes vendored modules, module cache paths, and Go toolchain paths.

### `posthog.WithFreshRequestContext`

```go
func WithFreshRequestContext(ctx context.Context, requestContext RequestContext) context.Context
```

WithFreshRequestContext returns a child context with PostHog request metadata attached without inheriting any existing PostHog request context from the parent.

### `posthog.WithRequestContext`

```go
func WithRequestContext(ctx context.Context, requestContext RequestContext) context.Context
```

WithRequestContext returns a child context with PostHog request metadata attached. Existing PostHog request context values are inherited: non-empty DistinctId and SessionId override the parent values, and Properties and Options are merged with child values taking precedence.

Feature flag error type constants for the $feature\_flag\_error property. These values are sent in analytics events to track flag evaluation failures. They should not be changed without considering impact on existing dashboards and queries that filter on these values.

```go
const (
	// CACHE_DEFAULT_SIZE is the number of feature flag calls tracked for local deduplication.
	CACHE_DEFAULT_SIZE = 300_000

	// DefaultIdleConns is the default max idle connections for the HTTP client.

### Variables

```go
var (
	// This error is returned by methods of the `Client` interface when they are
	// called after the client was already closed.
	ErrClosed = errors.New("the client was already closed")

	// This error is used to notify the application that too many requests are
	// already being sent and no more messages can be accepted.
	ErrTooManyRequests = errors.New("too many requests are already in-flight")

	// This error is used to notify the client callbacks that a message send
	// failed because the JSON representation of a message exceeded the upper
	// limit.
	ErrMessageTooBig = errors.New("the message exceeds the maximum allowed size")

	// ErrNoSecretKey is returned when a SecretKey is required for the requested
	// operation but was not configured.
	ErrNoSecretKey = errors.New("no SecretKey provided")

	// ErrNoPersonalAPIKey is a deprecated alias for ErrNoSecretKey. It refers to
	// the same error value, so errors.Is checks against either name still match.
	//
	// Deprecated: use ErrNoSecretKey.
	ErrNoPersonalAPIKey = ErrNoSecretKey

	// ErrNoDistinctID is returned when distinct_id is required for the requested
	// operation but was not provided.
	ErrNoDistinctID = errors.New("no distinct_id provided")

	// ErrQueueFull is returned by Enqueue/EnqueueWithContext when the in-memory

	// ErrSDKDisabled is returned by every method of a disabled client: one built
	// with Config.Disabled, or with an empty or personal (phx_) project API key.
	ErrSDKDisabled = errors.New("posthog SDK is disabled")
)
```

```go
var ErrFlagNotFound = errors.New("feature flag not found")
```

ErrFlagNotFound is returned when a feature flag does not exist or is disabled. Use errors.Is(err, ErrFlagNotFound) to check for this error.

## `FeatureFlagEvaluations`

```go
type FeatureFlagEvaluations struct {
	// contains filtered or unexported fields
}
```

FeatureFlagEvaluations is a snapshot of feature-flag evaluations for a single distinct\_id, returned by Client.EvaluateFlags. It is the recommended way to evaluate many flags for a single user with a single network request: the snapshot can power any number of IsEnabled / GetFlag checks and can be attached to a Capture event via Capture.Flags so the event carries the exact values the application branched on, with no additional /flags call.

Calls to IsEnabled and GetFlag fire $feature\_flag\_called (deduped per (distinct\_id, key, device\_id)). GetFlagPayload does not fire an event.

### `FeatureFlagEvaluations.GetFlag`

```go
func (e *FeatureFlagEvaluations) GetFlag(key string) interface{}
```

GetFlag returns the value of the flag: a string for multivariate flags, true or false for boolean flags, or nil for unknown flags. The first call for a given key fires $feature\_flag\_called with full evaluation metadata; subsequent calls with the same response are deduped.

### `FeatureFlagEvaluations.GetFlagPayload`

```go
func (e *FeatureFlagEvaluations) GetFlagPayload(key string) string
```

GetFlagPayload returns the raw JSON payload string for the flag, or "" if no payload is configured or the flag is unknown. Unlike IsEnabled and GetFlag, it does not record an access and does not fire an event.

### `FeatureFlagEvaluations.IsEnabled`

```go
func (e *FeatureFlagEvaluations) IsEnabled(key string) bool
```

IsEnabled reports whether the flag is enabled for this snapshot's user. Unknown flags return false. The first call for a given key fires $feature\_flag\_called with full evaluation metadata; subsequent calls with the same response are deduped against the client's per-distinct\_id cache.

### `FeatureFlagEvaluations.Keys`

```go
func (e *FeatureFlagEvaluations) Keys() []string
```

Keys returns the sorted list of evaluated flag keys.

### `FeatureFlagEvaluations.Only`

```go
func (e *FeatureFlagEvaluations) Only(keys []string) *FeatureFlagEvaluations
```

Only returns a filtered copy of this snapshot keeping only the named flags that were actually evaluated. Unknown keys are dropped with a warning.

The returned snapshot tracks access independently from the receiver.

### `FeatureFlagEvaluations.OnlyAccessed`

```go
func (e *FeatureFlagEvaluations) OnlyAccessed() *FeatureFlagEvaluations
```

OnlyAccessed returns a filtered copy of this snapshot containing only the flags that were accessed via IsEnabled or GetFlag before this call.

The method honors its name: if nothing has been accessed yet, the returned snapshot is empty. Pre-access the flags you want to attach before calling.

The returned snapshot tracks access independently from the receiver; further accesses on the child do not influence what the parent sees.

### `FeatureFlagEvaluations.UnresolvedFlags`

```go
func (e *FeatureFlagEvaluations) UnresolvedFlags() map[string]UnresolvedFlagReason
```

UnresolvedFlags returns the flags that have a loaded local definition but that neither local evaluation nor a remote fallback resolved, mapped to the reason local evaluation was inconclusive. These flags are absent from Keys, IsEnabled returns false and GetFlag returns nil for them. Reading this does not record an access and does not fire an event. The returned map is a copy.

Snapshots returned by Only and OnlyAccessed have no unresolved flags.

## Types

### `APIError`

```go
type APIError struct {
	// StatusCode is the HTTP status code returned by the PostHog API.
	StatusCode int
	// Message is the error message returned by or derived from the API response.
	Message string
}
```

APIError represents an HTTP API error with a status code. This allows classifyError to generate api\_error\_{status} strings.

#### `APIError.Error`

```go
func (e *APIError) Error() string
```

Error returns the API error message.

#### `posthog.NewAPIError`

```go
func NewAPIError(statusCode int, message string) *APIError
```

NewAPIError creates an APIError with the given HTTP status code and message.

### `APIMessage`

```go
type APIMessage interface{}
```

APIMessage is a wire-format message produced by Message.APIfy and passed to callbacks. Legacy API message structs may still expose top-level fields such as type, library, library\_version, and send\_feature\_flags for compatibility. Capture ingestion uses event plus properties such as $lib, $lib\_version, $feature/&lt;key>, and $active\_feature\_flags instead.

### `AliasInApi`

```go
type AliasInApi struct {
	// Type is the legacy message type sent to the batch API.
	// Deprecated: this field is ignored by PostHog ingestion and is kept for backwards compatibility.
	Type string `json:"type"`
	// Uuid is the valid event UUID sent to the batch API.
	Uuid string `json:"uuid"`
	// Library is the $lib the event is stored with.
	Library string `json:"library"`
	// LibraryVersion is the $lib_version the event is stored with.
	LibraryVersion string `json:"library_version"`
	// Timestamp is the event timestamp sent to the batch API in UTC.
	Timestamp time.Time `json:"timestamp"`

	// Properties contains alias-specific event properties.
	Properties AliasInApiProperties `json:"properties"`

	// Event is always $create_alias for Alias messages.
	Event string `json:"event"`
}
```

AliasInApi is the wire-format payload produced from an Alias message.

### `AliasInApiProperties`

```go
type AliasInApiProperties struct {
	// DistinctId is the canonical user distinct ID.
	DistinctId string `json:"distinct_id"`
	// Alias is the alternate distinct ID being linked to DistinctId.
	Alias string `json:"alias"`
	// Lib is the $lib the event is stored with.
	Lib string `json:"$lib"`
	// LibVersion is the $lib_version the event is stored with.
	LibVersion string `json:"$lib_version"`
	// IsServer marks the event as originating from a server-side SDK.
	// Omitted entirely when nil (Config.IsServer resolved to false).
	IsServer *bool `json:"$is_server,omitempty"`
	// DisableGeoIP is sent as $geoip_disable when GeoIP lookup is disabled.
	DisableGeoIP bool `json:"$geoip_disable,omitempty"`
}
```

AliasInApiProperties is the wire-format properties object for an Alias message.

#### `AliasInApiProperties.ToProperties`

```go
func (ctx AliasInApiProperties) ToProperties() Properties
```

### `Backoff`

```go
type Backoff struct {
	// contains filtered or unexported fields
}
```

Backoff calculates exponential retry delays with optional jitter and a maximum cap.

#### `Backoff.Duration`

```go
func (b *Backoff) Duration(attempt int) time.Duration
```

Duration returns the backoff interval for the given attempt.

#### `Backoff.NewTicker`

```go
func (b *Backoff) NewTicker() *Ticker
```

NewTicker starts a ticker that waits Duration(0), Duration(1), and so on between ticks.

#### `Backoff.Sleep`

```go
func (b *Backoff) Sleep(attempt int)
```

Sleep pauses the current goroutine for the backoff interval for the given attempt.

#### `posthog.DefaultBackoff`

```go
func DefaultBackoff() *Backoff
```

DefaultBackoff creates a Backoff with the SDK's default retry policy:

```text
base: 100 milliseconds
factor: 2
jitter: 0.25 (each delay is scaled by a random factor in [0.75, 1.25])
cap: 30 seconds
```

#### `posthog.NewBackoff`

```go
func NewBackoff(base time.Duration, factor uint8, jitter float64, cap time.Duration) *Backoff
```

NewBackoff creates a Backoff with the provided base duration, exponential factor, jitter ratio, and maximum cap duration. A jitter ratio j scales each delay by a uniform random factor in \[1-j, 1+j] before the cap applies.

### `Callback`

```go
type Callback interface {
	// Success is called for every message that was successfully sent to the API.
	Success(APIMessage)

	// Failure is called for every message that failed to be sent to the API and
	// will be discarded by the client. The error describes the send or serialization failure.
	Failure(APIMessage, error)
}
```

Callback is implemented by applications that want delivery notifications.

Callback methods are called by a client's internal goroutines. There are no guarantees about which goroutine triggers the callbacks, whether calls are made sequentially or in parallel, or whether callback order matches enqueue order.

Callback methods must return quickly and avoid long blocking operations so they do not interfere with the client's internal workflow.

### `CaptureEventError`

```go
type CaptureEventError struct {
	// EventUUID is the uuid of the rejected event (matches Capture.Uuid etc.).
	EventUUID string
	// Result is the server's per-event directive, e.g. "drop" or "retry".
	Result string
	// Details is the server-supplied explanation, when present (may be empty).
	Details string
	// Exhausted is true when the event was still retryable but the SDK ran out
	// of attempts, false for a server-directed terminal drop.
	Exhausted bool
	// Endpoint is the capture path the event was sent to, so one Callback can
	// tell the analytics and AI lanes apart.
	Endpoint string
}
```

CaptureEventError is delivered to Callback.Failure for a single event that the capture endpoint rejected: either a terminal "drop" result, or an event still asking to "retry" once the attempt budget is exhausted. Callers can use errors.As to inspect the per-event outcome.

This error type is produced exclusively on the 200-with-partial-results path — when the batch-level HTTP exchange succeeds but individual events within the batch are rejected or not persisted. It is never returned for batch-level transport failures (use CaptureRequestError for those via errors.As).

#### `CaptureEventError.Error`

```go
func (e *CaptureEventError) Error() string
```

### `CaptureInApi`

```go
type CaptureInApi struct {
	// Type is the legacy message discriminator retained for callbacks.
	// Deprecated: PostHog ignores this top-level field for capture events, so it
	// is no longer serialized. Use Event for the captured event name.
	Type string `json:"-"`
	// Uuid is the valid event UUID sent to the batch API.
	Uuid string `json:"uuid"`
	// Library is the $lib the event is stored with, for callbacks. It is not
	// serialized: the wire carries $lib in Properties.
	Library string `json:"-"`
	// LibraryVersion is the $lib_version the event is stored with, for
	// callbacks. It is not serialized: the wire carries $lib_version in
	// Properties.
	LibraryVersion string `json:"-"`
	// Timestamp is the event timestamp sent to the batch API in UTC.
	Timestamp time.Time `json:"timestamp"`

	// DistinctId identifies the user or entity for the event.
	DistinctId string `json:"distinct_id"`
	// Event is the captured event name.
	Event string `json:"event"`
	// Properties contains event, SDK, system, group, and feature flag properties.
	Properties Properties `json:"properties"`
	// SendFeatureFlags carries the legacy send_feature_flags value for callbacks.
	// Deprecated: PostHog ignores this top-level field, so it is no longer
	// serialized. Use Capture.Flags to send the canonical $feature/<key> and
	// $active_feature_flags properties.
	SendFeatureFlags SendFeatureFlagsValue `json:"-"`
}
```

CaptureInApi is the wire-format payload produced from a Capture message.

### `CaptureLocalError`

```go
type CaptureLocalError struct {
	// Endpoint is the capture path the event was bound for.
	Endpoint string
	// Err is the underlying cause.
	Err error
}
```

CaptureLocalError is delivered to Callback.Failure for an event the SDK refused itself, before any request: an oversized event, a full batch queue, a serialization failure, or a panic in the batch processor. It names the lane so one Callback can tell them apart, and unwraps to the cause, so errors.Is against ErrMessageTooBig and friends still works.

A full in-memory queue is not reported here: Enqueue returns ErrQueueFull to the caller instead.

#### `CaptureLocalError.Error`

```go
func (e *CaptureLocalError) Error() string
```

#### `CaptureLocalError.Unwrap`

```go
func (e *CaptureLocalError) Unwrap() error
```

### `CaptureRequestError`

```go
type CaptureRequestError struct {
	// StatusCode is the HTTP status, or 0 if the request never got a response.
	StatusCode int
	// Code is the machine-readable error from the response body (may be empty).
	Code string
	// Description is the human-readable error from the response body (may be empty).
	Description string
	// Err is the underlying transport or body-parse error, if any.
	Err error
	// Endpoint is the capture path the request was sent to, so one Callback can
	// tell the analytics and AI lanes apart.
	Endpoint string
}
```

CaptureRequestError is delivered to Callback.Failure when an entire capture request fails: a non-2xx status, a transport error, or a malformed 2xx body. It carries the HTTP status and any structured error body the endpoint returned, and unwraps to the underlying transport/parse error when there is one.

This error type covers batch-level failures — transport errors, terminal HTTP statuses (400/401/402/...), retryable statuses (429, 5xx, ...) whose retry budget is exhausted, and 2xx responses with unparseable bodies. For per-event failures within a successful batch response, see CaptureEventError.

#### `CaptureRequestError.Error`

```go
func (e *CaptureRequestError) Error() string
```

#### `CaptureRequestError.Unwrap`

```go
func (e *CaptureRequestError) Unwrap() error
```

### `CodeEmail`

```go
type CodeEmail struct {
	// To is one recipient email address.
	To string
	// TemplateKey names the email, such as "password-reset", so its metrics,
	// logs and status group under it in PostHog. Letters, digits, hyphens and
	// underscores, at most 400.
	TemplateKey string
	Subject     string
	// HTML is the HTML body. Set HTML, Text or both.
	HTML string
	// Text is the plain-text body. Without it, PostHog derives it from HTML.
	Text string
	// From is a verified sender, such as "Acme <security@example.com>".
	// Without it, PostHog sends from the project's default sender.
	From    string
	ReplyTo []string
	// CaptureEngagement says whether PostHog captures the email's engagement
	// events, such as opens and clicks, as events of the recipient. Nil means
	// true. A project whose admin turned engagement capture off captures
	// nothing, whatever the send asks.
	CaptureEngagement *bool
	// DistinctID is the recipient's distinct ID in your product. The email's
	// events go to this person. Without it, they go to a person whose distinct
	// ID is the email address.
	DistinctID string
	// IdempotencyKey is 1 to 255 visible ASCII characters. See
	// TemplateEmail.IdempotencyKey.
	IdempotencyKey string
	// MaxRetries overrides Config.EmailRequestMaxRetries for this send.
	// Ptr(0) turns retries off.
	MaxRetries *int
}
```

CodeEmail sends content your code rendered, named by a key. PostHog sends it as is and never stores it. To send a React email, render it to HTML in your app and pass the HTML.

### `CommonResponseFields`

```go
type CommonResponseFields struct {
	// QuotaLimited lists quota-limited resources returned by the API.
	QuotaLimited []string `json:"quota_limited"`
	// RequestId is the API request identifier for tracing flag evaluation.
	RequestId string `json:"requestId"`
	// EvaluatedAt is the server evaluation timestamp, when returned.
	EvaluatedAt *int64 `json:"evaluatedAt"`
	// ErrorsWhileComputingFlags reports whether the server had errors computing any flags.
	ErrorsWhileComputingFlags bool `json:"errorsWhileComputingFlags"`
	// MinimalFlagCalledEvents reports whether the server enabled minimal
	// $feature_flag_called events for this project. The server sends it only
	// when the gate is on; absence means full events.
	MinimalFlagCalledEvents bool `json:"minimalFlagCalledEvents"`
}
```

CommonResponseFields contains fields common to all flags response versions.

### `CompressionMode`

```go
type CompressionMode uint8
```

CompressionMode specifies the compression algorithm for batch payloads.

```go
const (
	// CompressionNone disables compression (default).
	CompressionNone CompressionMode = 0
	// CompressionGzip enables GZIP compression for batch payloads.
	CompressionGzip CompressionMode = 1
	// CompressionZstd enables Zstandard compression.
	CompressionZstd CompressionMode = 2
	// CompressionDeflate enables zlib (RFC 1950) compression, sent as
	// Content-Encoding: deflate.
	CompressionDeflate CompressionMode = 3
	// CompressionBrotli enables Brotli compression, sent as
	// Content-Encoding: br.
	CompressionBrotli CompressionMode = 4
)
```

#### `CompressionMode.String`

```go
func (m CompressionMode) String() string
```

String returns a human-readable codec name, used in config validation errors and debug logs. It is not the on-the-wire Content-Encoding token (brotli's token is "br"); see compressBody for wire tokens.

### `ConfigError`

```go
type ConfigError struct {
	// A human-readable message explaining why the configuration field's value
	// is invalid.
	Reason string

	// The name of the configuration field that was carrying an invalid value.
	Field string

	// The value of the configuration field that caused the error.
	Value interface{}
}
```

ConfigError is returned by NewWithConfig when a Config field has an invalid value.

#### `ConfigError.Error`

```go
func (e ConfigError) Error() string
```

Error returns a human-readable configuration error message.

### `DebugImage`

```go
type DebugImage struct {
	// Type is the image format: "elf" on Linux, "macho" on macOS.
	Type string `json:"type"`
	// DebugID identifies the uploaded symbol set for this image.
	DebugID string `json:"debug_id"`
	// CodeID is the full code identifier (the complete GNU build ID on ELF).
	CodeID string `json:"code_id,omitempty"`
	// ImageAddr is the runtime load address of the image, as hex.
	ImageAddr string `json:"image_addr"`
	// ImageSize is the loaded extent of the image in bytes.
	ImageSize uint64 `json:"image_size,omitempty"`
	// ImageVmaddr is the link-time base address of the image, as hex.
	ImageVmaddr string `json:"image_vmaddr,omitempty"`
	// CodeFile is the path of the binary on disk.
	CodeFile string `json:"code_file,omitempty"`
	// Arch is the processor architecture the image was built for.
	Arch string `json:"arch"`
}
```

DebugImage describes a binary image loaded into the process, sent as the event-level $debug\_images property so PostHog can symbolicate raw frame addresses against debug symbols uploaded with `posthog-cli symbol-sets upload`.

### `DebugImageProvider`

```go
type DebugImageProvider interface {
	GetDebugImages() []DebugImage
}
```

DebugImageProvider is implemented by stack trace extractors that can also report the binary images their frames reference. Integrations that accept a StackTraceExtractor (e.g. the slog capture handler) use it to attach $debug\_images to the exceptions they build.

### `DecideRequestData`

```go
type DecideRequestData struct {
	// ApiKey is the PostHog project API key.
	ApiKey string `json:"api_key"`
	// DistinctId is the user distinct ID to evaluate flags for.
	DistinctId string `json:"distinct_id"`
	// Groups contains group identifiers for group-targeted flags.
	Groups Groups `json:"groups"`
	// PersonProperties overrides person properties for this evaluation.
	PersonProperties Properties `json:"person_properties"`
	// GroupProperties overrides group properties for this evaluation, keyed by group type.
	GroupProperties map[string]Properties `json:"group_properties"`
}
```

DecideRequestData is the legacy wire-format request body for flag decide calls.

### `DecideResponse`

```go
type DecideResponse struct {
	// FeatureFlags contains evaluated flag values keyed by flag key.
	FeatureFlags map[string]interface{} `json:"featureFlags"`
	// FeatureFlagPayloads contains raw payloads keyed by flag key.
	FeatureFlagPayloads map[string]json.RawMessage `json:"featureFlagPayloads"`
}
```

DecideResponse is the legacy wire-format response body for flag decide calls.

### `DefaultStackTraceExtractor`

```go
type DefaultStackTraceExtractor struct {
	// InAppDecider decides whether each runtime frame is application code.
	// Set it to SimpleInAppDecider or another non-nil function before use.
	InAppDecider InAppDecider
}
```

DefaultStackTraceExtractor is provided by default as a sane / simple implementation of a StackTraceExtractor. It should be enough for most use cases, however, you're free to create your own implementation if you require more flexibility.

#### `DefaultStackTraceExtractor.GetDebugImages`

```go
func (d DefaultStackTraceExtractor) GetDebugImages() []DebugImage
```

GetDebugImages returns the debug images referenced by captured frames — currently the main executable, when its identity could be determined.

#### `DefaultStackTraceExtractor.GetStackTrace`

```go
func (d DefaultStackTraceExtractor) GetStackTrace(skip int) *ExceptionStacktrace
```

GetStackTrace captures the current goroutine stack in wire order (outermost frame first, capture site last). The skip parameter omits leading runtime.Callers frames before conversion.

When the running executable's identity is known (see DebugImage), frames are emitted as client-expanded inline groups for server-side symbolication: each physical stack frame and the entries the runtime synthesizes for calls inlined into it share one raw return address, with the synthesized layers tagged inline. PostHog resolves that address once against uploaded debug symbols and atomically replaces the whole group with its own expansion (exact inline chain, source context), or keeps these runtime-resolved frames verbatim when no symbols are uploaded. When the executable can't be identified, frames keep the plain pre-existing shape.

### `DescriptionExtractor`

```go
type DescriptionExtractor interface {
	// ExtractDescription returns the ExceptionItem.Value to use for a slog record.
	ExtractDescription(r slog.Record) string
}
```

DescriptionExtractor defines the interface for extracting a human-readable description from a slog.Record for use in exception capture.

Implementations should always return a non-empty string; returning an empty string will prevent the error from being captured.

### `Email`

```go
type Email interface {
	// contains filtered or unexported methods
}
```

Email is the content of one send: a TemplateEmail or a CodeEmail.

### `EmailError`

```go
type EmailError struct {
	Name    EmailErrorName
	Code    string
	Message string
	// StatusCode is the HTTP status when PostHog answered, and 0 otherwise.
	// A network_error keeps the status of an answer that broke off mid-body.
	StatusCode int
	Why        string
	Fix        string
	DocsURL    string
	// Field names the request field the error is about, when there is one.
	Field string
	// RetryAfter is how long PostHog asked the client to wait before it sends
	// again, and 0 when it did not ask.
	RetryAfter time.Duration
}
```

EmailError reports that PostHog did not queue the email or return its status, or that the client could not tell whether it did. Every error that Emails returns is an \*EmailError; read it with errors.As.

Branch on Code, PostHog's stable error code such as "recipient\_suppressed", or an SDK code such as "network\_error" or "missing\_app\_host". Name is its coarse category. The error never holds the secret key or the request body.

#### `EmailError.Error`

```go
func (e *EmailError) Error() string
```

#### `EmailError.Unwrap`

```go
func (e *EmailError) Unwrap() error
```

Unwrap returns the cause, such as a network error, context.DeadlineExceeded, ErrSDKDisabled or ErrClosed.

### `EmailErrorName`

```go
type EmailErrorName string
```

EmailErrorName is a coarse category of an EmailError, for code that branches on the kind of failure rather than the exact code. The names follow Resend's error names, so code moved from Resend keeps working.

```go
const (
	// EmailErrorValidation: PostHog or the client refused the email as sent,
	// such as an unverified sender, a suppressed recipient or an argument the
	// client checks before any request.
	EmailErrorValidation EmailErrorName = "validation_error"
	// EmailErrorMissingAPIKey: the client has no secret key, or PostHog
	// refused it.
	EmailErrorMissingAPIKey EmailErrorName = "missing_api_key"
	// EmailErrorInvalidPermission: the secret key lacks the scope.
	EmailErrorInvalidPermission EmailErrorName = "invalid_permission"
	// EmailErrorNotFound: no template or email with this ID, or the API is not
	// enabled for the project.
	EmailErrorNotFound EmailErrorName = "not_found"
	// EmailErrorConcurrentIdempotentRequests: a send with the same idempotency
	// key is still in flight.
	EmailErrorConcurrentIdempotentRequests EmailErrorName = "concurrent_idempotent_requests"
	// EmailErrorInvalidIdempotentRequest: the idempotency key was used with
	// another request.
	EmailErrorInvalidIdempotentRequest EmailErrorName = "invalid_idempotent_request"
	// EmailErrorRateLimitExceeded: PostHog rate limited the request.
	EmailErrorRateLimitExceeded EmailErrorName = "rate_limit_exceeded"
	// EmailErrorMonthlyQuotaExceeded: the project is over its email quota.
	EmailErrorMonthlyQuotaExceeded EmailErrorName = "monthly_quota_exceeded"
	// EmailErrorServiceUnavailable: PostHog or the network was unavailable.
	EmailErrorServiceUnavailable EmailErrorName = "service_unavailable"
	// EmailErrorApplication: anything else.
	EmailErrorApplication EmailErrorName = "application_error"
)
```

### `EmailStatus`

```go
type EmailStatus struct {
	// ID is the message ID that Send returned.
	ID string
	// Status is "queued", "sent", "failed", "delivered", "bounced" or
	// "complained" today. Later SDK versions can see values this list does not
	// have yet.
	Status string
	// CreatedAt is when PostHog queued the email.
	CreatedAt time.Time
	// StatusAt is when the email reached its current status.
	StatusAt time.Time
	// Reason says why a failed email was not sent, such as "provider_error" or
	// "recipient_suppressed", or gives the bounce type of a bounced email:
	// "hard", "soft" or "unknown". It is empty otherwise.
	Reason string
}
```

EmailStatus is what happened to an email that Emails.Send queued.

### `EmailWarning`

```go
type EmailWarning struct {
	Code    string
	Message string
	Fix     string
}
```

EmailWarning is a warning PostHog returned with a queued email.

### `Emails`

```go
type Emails interface {
	// Send queues one email, from a TemplateEmail made in PostHog or from a
	// CodeEmail your code rendered. A result means PostHog queued the email,
	// not that it was delivered.
	Send(ctx context.Context, email Email) (*SendEmailResult, error)

	// Get reads the status of an email that Send queued, for 30 days after the
	// send. The error code is "not_found" when no email of the project has the
	// ID, when the email is older than 30 days, or for a few seconds after the
	// send.
	Get(ctx context.Context, messageID string) (*EmailStatus, error)
}
```

Emails sends transactional email, such as a password reset or a receipt, to one recipient per call, and reads the status of an email it sent.

It needs Config.SecretKey, a project secret API key (phs\_...) with the transactional\_email:write scope, the "Send transactional email" preset in your project settings. A key with only transactional\_email:read can read statuses but not send. Keys made with hog\_flow:write still work. Requests go to Config.AppHost, or to the PostHog Cloud app host of Config.Endpoint.

Every error is an \*EmailError. Network errors, rate limits, an idempotency key in flight and an unavailable service are retried up to Config.EmailRequestMaxRetries times, with the same idempotency key.

### `EnqueueClient`

```go
type EnqueueClient interface {
	// Enqueue queues a message to be sent by the client when the conditions for a batch
	// upload are met.
	// This is the main method you'll be using, a typical flow would look like
	// this:
	//
	//	client, err := posthog.New(apiKey)
	//	if err != nil {
	//	    return err
	//	}
	//	...
	//	client.Enqueue(posthog.Capture{ ... })
	//	...
	//	client.Close()
	//
	// Enqueue returns an error if the message could not be queued, which happens
	// when the client is closed, the message is invalid, or the in-memory queue
	// is full (ErrQueueFull) -- in the latter case the message is dropped rather
	// than blocking the caller. A full-queue drop is reported only through this
	// returned error, not through Callback.Failure.
	//
	// Bulk or backfill workloads that can enqueue faster than the client uploads
	// should check the returned error for ErrQueueFull and throttle or retry (or
	// raise Config.MaxQueueSize); otherwise events are dropped, not delayed.
	Enqueue(Message) error
}
```

EnqueueClient is the minimal interface implemented by clients that can queue PostHog messages.

### `ErrorExtractor`

```go
type ErrorExtractor struct {
	// ErrorKeys are attribute keys to inspect for error values, case-insensitively.
	ErrorKeys []string
	// Fallback is returned when no matching error attribute is found.
	Fallback string
}
```

ErrorExtractor implements DescriptionExtractor by scanning a slog.Record for attributes containing an error.

ErrorKeys specifies the list of attribute keys (case-insensitive) to check. The first matching attribute with an error value is returned as the description. If no matching error is found, the Fallback is returned.

#### `ErrorExtractor.ExtractDescription`

```go
func (e ErrorExtractor) ExtractDescription(r slog.Record) string
```

ExtractDescription returns the first matching error string from the slog record or Fallback.

### `ExceptionInApi`

```go
type ExceptionInApi struct {
	// Type is the legacy message type sent to the batch API.
	// Deprecated: this field is ignored by PostHog ingestion and is kept for backwards compatibility.
	Type string `json:"type"`
	// Uuid is the valid event UUID sent to the batch API.
	Uuid string `json:"uuid"`
	// Library is the $lib the event is stored with.
	Library string `json:"library"`
	// LibraryVersion is the $lib_version the event is stored with.
	LibraryVersion string `json:"library_version"`
	// Timestamp is the event timestamp sent to the batch API in UTC.
	Timestamp time.Time `json:"timestamp"`
	// Event is always $exception for Exception messages.
	Event string `json:"event"`
	// Properties contains built-in and custom exception properties.
	Properties ExceptionInApiProperties `json:"properties"`
}
```

ExceptionInApi is the wire-format payload produced from an Exception message.

### `ExceptionInApiProperties`

```go
type ExceptionInApiProperties struct {
	// Lib is the $lib the event is stored with.
	Lib string `json:"$lib"`
	// LibVersion is the $lib_version the event is stored with.
	LibVersion string `json:"$lib_version"`
	// IsServer marks the event as originating from a server-side SDK.
	// Omitted entirely when nil (Config.IsServer resolved to false).
	IsServer *bool `json:"$is_server,omitempty"`
	// DistinctId is the user distinct ID associated with the exception.
	DistinctId string `json:"distinct_id"`
	// DisableGeoIP is sent as $geoip_disable when GeoIP lookup is disabled.
	DisableGeoIP bool `json:"$geoip_disable,omitempty"`
	// DebugImages is sent as $debug_images when "native" frames are present.
	DebugImages []DebugImage `json:"$debug_images,omitempty"`
	// ExceptionList is sent as $exception_list.
	ExceptionList []ExceptionItem `json:"$exception_list"`
	// ExceptionFingerprint is sent as $exception_fingerprint when provided.
	ExceptionFingerprint *string `json:"$exception_fingerprint,omitempty"`

	// Custom is flattened into the wire "properties" on marshal.
	// Typed fields win on collision.
	Custom Properties `json:"-"`
}
```

ExceptionInApiProperties is the wire-format properties object for an Exception message.

#### `ExceptionInApiProperties.MarshalJSON`

```go
func (p ExceptionInApiProperties) MarshalJSON() ([]byte, error)
```

MarshalJSON lets users add extra keys (via Custom) to the event's JSON output next to the built-in ones like $lib and distinct\_id. If a custom key clashes with a built-in, we keep ours and drop theirs.

#### `ExceptionInApiProperties.ToProperties`

```go
func (ctx ExceptionInApiProperties) ToProperties() Properties
```

### `ExceptionItem`

```go
type ExceptionItem struct {
	// Type is rendered as the exception title in the PostHog UI.
	Type string `json:"type"`
	// Value is rendered as the exception description in the PostHog UI.
	Value string `json:"value"`
	// Mechanism describes how the exception was produced or handled.
	Mechanism *ExceptionMechanism `json:"mechanism,omitempty"`
	// Stacktrace contains stack frames for the exception. Use StackTraceExtractor to generate it.
	Stacktrace *ExceptionStacktrace `json:"stacktrace,omitempty"`
}
```

ExceptionItem describes one exception in an Exception event.

#### `ExceptionItem.Validate`

```go
func (msg ExceptionItem) Validate() error
```

Validate checks that the exception item has Type and Value set.

### `ExceptionMechanism`

```go
type ExceptionMechanism struct {
	// Handled reports whether the exception was handled by application code.
	Handled *bool `json:"handled,omitempty"`
	// Synthetic reports whether the exception was synthesized by instrumentation.
	Synthetic *bool `json:"synthetic,omitempty"`
}
```

ExceptionMechanism describes whether an exception was handled or synthesized.

### `ExceptionStacktrace`

```go
type ExceptionStacktrace struct {
	// Type is the stack trace representation type. The default extractor uses "raw".
	Type string `json:"type"`
	// Frames is the ordered list of stack frames.
	Frames []StackFrame `json:"frames"`
}
```

ExceptionStacktrace is a PostHog-compatible stack trace.

### `FeatureFlag`

```go
type FeatureFlag struct {
	// Key is the feature flag key.
	Key string `json:"key"`
	// EvaluationRuntime is the flag's configured runtime, or nil when unknown.
	EvaluationRuntime *string `json:"evaluation_runtime"`
	// RolloutPercentage is the top-level rollout percentage, when configured.
	RolloutPercentage *float64 `json:"rollout_percentage"`
	// Active reports whether the flag is active.
	Active bool `json:"active"`
	// Filters contains matching conditions, variants, and payloads.
	Filters Filter `json:"filters"`
	// EnsureExperienceContinuity indicates that the flag requires server-side continuity checks.
	EnsureExperienceContinuity *bool `json:"ensure_experience_continuity"`
	// BucketingIdentifier optionally selects the property used for hash bucketing.
	BucketingIdentifier *string `json:"bucketing_identifier"`
	// HasExperiment reports whether the flag is linked to an experiment.
	// Nil when the server does not send it (older deployments).
	HasExperiment *bool `json:"has_experiment"`
}
```

FeatureFlag is a feature flag definition returned by the local evaluation endpoint.

### `FeatureFlagCondition`

```go
type FeatureFlagCondition struct {
	// Properties are the targeting rules in this condition group.
	Properties []FlagProperty `json:"properties"`
	// RolloutPercentage is the rollout percentage for this condition group.
	RolloutPercentage *float64 `json:"rollout_percentage"`
	// Variant is the variant key forced by this condition group, when any.
	Variant *string `json:"variant"`
	// AggregationGroupTypeIndex identifies the group type for this condition group.
	AggregationGroupTypeIndex *uint8 `json:"aggregation_group_type_index"`
}
```

FeatureFlagCondition describes one condition group for a feature flag.

### `FeatureFlagPayload`

```go
type FeatureFlagPayload struct {
	// Key is the feature flag key to evaluate. It is required.
	Key string
	// DistinctId is the user distinct ID to evaluate the flag for. It is required.
	DistinctId string
	// DeviceId optionally provides a device_id for remote /flags requests and event deduplication.
	DeviceId *string
	// Groups supplies group identifiers for group-targeted flags.
	Groups Groups
	// PersonProperties overrides person properties used during flag evaluation.
	PersonProperties Properties
	// GroupProperties overrides group properties used during flag evaluation, keyed by group type.
	GroupProperties map[string]Properties
	// OnlyEvaluateLocally prevents fallback to remote /flags requests.
	OnlyEvaluateLocally bool
	// SendFeatureFlagEvents controls whether $feature_flag_called is captured.
	// Nil defaults to true during validation.
	SendFeatureFlagEvents *bool
}
```

FeatureFlagPayload configures a single legacy feature flag evaluation. It is used by Client.GetFeatureFlag, Client.IsFeatureEnabled, Client.GetFeatureFlagResult, and Client.GetFeatureFlagPayload.

### `FeatureFlagPayloadNoKey`

```go
type FeatureFlagPayloadNoKey struct {
	// DistinctId is the user distinct ID to evaluate flags for. It is required.
	DistinctId string
	// DeviceId optionally provides a device_id for remote /flags requests and event deduplication.
	DeviceId *string
	// Groups supplies group identifiers for group-targeted flags.
	Groups Groups
	// PersonProperties overrides person properties used during flag evaluation.
	PersonProperties Properties
	// GroupProperties overrides group properties used during flag evaluation, keyed by group type.
	GroupProperties map[string]Properties
	// OnlyEvaluateLocally prevents fallback to remote /flags requests.
	OnlyEvaluateLocally bool
	// SendFeatureFlagEvents is reserved for parity with single-flag payloads.
	// Nil defaults to true during validation; GetAllFlags does not currently emit per-flag access events.
	SendFeatureFlagEvents *bool
}
```

FeatureFlagPayloadNoKey configures legacy evaluation of all flags for one user. It is used by Client.GetAllFlags.

### `FeatureFlagResult`

```go
type FeatureFlagResult struct {
	// Key is the feature flag key that was evaluated
	Key string

	// Enabled indicates whether the feature flag evaluation determined
	// the flag to be in an enabled state.
	Enabled bool

	// RawPayload is the serialized JSON payload associated with the flag variant.
	// Nil if no payload is configured.
	// Use GetPayloadAs to unmarshal the payload into a specific type.
	RawPayload *string

	// Variant is the variant key if this is a multivariate flag.
	// Nil for boolean flags.
	Variant *string
}
```

FeatureFlagResult represents the result of a feature flag evaluation, containing both the flag value and its payload.

#### `FeatureFlagResult.GetPayloadAs`

```go
func (r *FeatureFlagResult) GetPayloadAs(v interface{}) error
```

GetPayloadAs unmarshals the JSON payload into the provided type. Returns an error if the payload is empty or cannot be unmarshaled.

### `FeatureFlagsPoller`

```go
type FeatureFlagsPoller struct {
	// Logger receives poller warnings and errors.
	Logger Logger
	// Endpoint is the PostHog API host used by the poller.
	Endpoint string
}
```

FeatureFlagsPoller periodically loads feature flag definitions for local evaluation. Applications normally interact with it through Client methods rather than constructing it directly.

#### `FeatureFlagsPoller.ForceReload`

```go
func (poller *FeatureFlagsPoller) ForceReload()
```

ForceReload requests an immediate reload of local feature flag definitions. It does nothing once the poller has shut down. The send selects on shutdown so a reload racing Close cannot send on a closed channel.

#### `FeatureFlagsPoller.GetAllFlags`

```go
func (poller *FeatureFlagsPoller) GetAllFlags(flagConfig FeatureFlagPayloadNoKey) (map[string]interface{}, error)
```

GetAllFlags evaluates every available flag for the configured user. Values are bools for boolean flags or strings for multivariate variants.

#### `FeatureFlagsPoller.GetFeatureFlag`

```go
func (poller *FeatureFlagsPoller) GetFeatureFlag(flagConfig FeatureFlagPayload) (interface{}, bool, error)
```

GetFeatureFlag evaluates one flag using locally loaded definitions when possible. It returns the flag value, whether that value was locally evaluated, and an error. If local evaluation is inconclusive and OnlyEvaluateLocally is false, it falls back to /flags.

#### `FeatureFlagsPoller.GetFeatureFlagPayload`

```go
func (poller *FeatureFlagsPoller) GetFeatureFlagPayload(flagConfig FeatureFlagPayload) (string, error)
```

GetFeatureFlagPayload returns the payload for the evaluated flag value. It tries local payloads first and falls back to the remote API unless OnlyEvaluateLocally is true.

#### `FeatureFlagsPoller.GetFeatureFlagWithPayload`

```go
func (poller *FeatureFlagsPoller) GetFeatureFlagWithPayload(flagConfig FeatureFlagPayload) flagValueAndPayload
```

GetFeatureFlagWithPayload evaluates a feature flag once and returns both its value and payload. This avoids the double evaluation that would happen when calling GetFeatureFlag and GetFeatureFlagPayload separately.

#### `FeatureFlagsPoller.GetFeatureFlags`

```go
func (poller *FeatureFlagsPoller) GetFeatureFlags() ([]FeatureFlag, error)
```

GetFeatureFlags returns the locally loaded feature flag definitions. It waits for the initial poll to complete and returns an error if flags were not loaded.

### `FeatureFlagsResponse`

```go
type FeatureFlagsResponse struct {
	// Flags contains feature flag definitions for local evaluation.
	Flags []FeatureFlag `json:"flags"`
	// GroupTypeMapping maps group type indexes to group type names.
	GroupTypeMapping *map[string]string `json:"group_type_mapping"`
	// Cohorts contains cohort definitions referenced by local feature flags.
	Cohorts map[string]PropertyGroup `json:"cohorts"`
	// MinimalFlagCalledEvents reports whether the server enabled minimal
	// $feature_flag_called events for this project. The server sends it only
	// when the gate is on; absence means full events.
	MinimalFlagCalledEvents bool `json:"minimal_flag_called_events"`
}
```

FeatureFlagsResponse is the wire-format response from the local evaluation endpoint.

### `FieldError`

```go
type FieldError struct {
	// The human-readable representation of the type of structure that wasn't
	// initialized properly.
	Type string

	// The name of the field that wasn't properly initialized.
	Name string

	// The value of the field that wasn't properly initialized.
	Value interface{}
}
```

FieldError describes an invalid required field in a message passed to the SDK.

#### `FieldError.Error`

```go
func (e FieldError) Error() string
```

Error returns a human-readable field validation error message.

### `Filter`

```go
type Filter struct {
	// AggregationGroupTypeIndex identifies the group type for group-targeted flags.
	AggregationGroupTypeIndex *uint8 `json:"aggregation_group_type_index"`
	// Groups contains the ordered condition groups to evaluate.
	Groups []FeatureFlagCondition `json:"groups"`
	// EarlyExit, when true, stops local condition evaluation and returns a
	// definitive disabled result as soon as a condition group matches its
	// property filters (or has none) but the rollout percentage excludes the
	// user, instead of falling through to later condition groups.
	EarlyExit bool `json:"early_exit"`
	// Multivariate contains variant definitions for multivariate flags.
	Multivariate *Variants `json:"multivariate"`
	// Holdout contains the experiment holdout configuration, when the flag has one.
	Holdout *Holdout `json:"holdout"`
	// Payloads maps flag values or variant keys to raw JSON payloads.
	Payloads map[string]json.RawMessage `json:"payloads"`
	// DecodedPayloads holds pre-decoded string versions of Payloads.
	// Built once at flag load time to avoid per-evaluation json.Unmarshal / unquoting.
	DecodedPayloads map[string]string `json:"-"`
	// VariantLookupTable is pre-computed at flag load time to avoid per-evaluation
	// slice allocation for multivariate flags.
	VariantLookupTable []FlagVariantMeta `json:"-"`
}
```

Filter contains the targeting rules, variants, and payloads for a FeatureFlag.

### `FlagDefinitionCacheProvider`

```go
type FlagDefinitionCacheProvider interface {
	// GetFlagDefinitions returns the cached JSON, or nil when nothing is cached.
	GetFlagDefinitions(ctx context.Context) (json.RawMessage, error)

	// ShouldFetchFlagDefinitions reports whether this instance should fetch
	// definitions from PostHog on this poll. Only instances with a SecretKey call
	// this method, so cache-only readers cannot acquire a fetch lease.
	ShouldFetchFlagDefinitions(ctx context.Context) (bool, error)

	// OnFlagDefinitionsReceived stores the JSON fetched from PostHog unchanged.
	OnFlagDefinitionsReceived(ctx context.Context, data json.RawMessage) error

	// Shutdown releases any resources held by the provider, such as a lock
	// acquired by ShouldFetchFlagDefinitions. It runs after active provider calls
	// finish. If client shutdown times out, cleanup may complete after Close or
	// CloseWithContext returns.
	Shutdown(ctx context.Context) error
}
```

FlagDefinitionCacheProvider shares feature flag definitions between SDK instances through an external cache such as Redis. Definition data is opaque: providers store and return it unchanged; the SDK validates and interprets it. Without a SecretKey, SDK instances only read the cache and never consult the fetch decision or publish definitions. Instances with a SecretKey consult the fetch decision and publish definitions after an elected fetch. Implementations should honor context cancellation so polling and resource cleanup can finish promptly.

EXPERIMENTAL: this interface may change in a minor version bump.

### `FlagDetail`

```go
type FlagDetail struct {
	// Key is the feature flag key.
	Key string `json:"key"`
	// Enabled reports whether the flag is enabled for the evaluated user.
	Enabled bool `json:"enabled"`
	// Variant is the matched variant key for multivariate flags, or nil for boolean flags.
	Variant *string `json:"variant"`
	// Reason explains why the flag matched or did not match, when provided by the API.
	Reason *FlagReason `json:"reason"`
	// Metadata contains IDs, version, payload, and optional flag description.
	Metadata FlagMetadata `json:"metadata"`
	// Failed is true when the API could not evaluate this flag due to a transient failure.
	Failed *bool `json:"failed,omitempty"`
}
```

FlagDetail represents one evaluated feature flag in the v4 /flags response format.

#### `FlagDetail.GetValue`

```go
func (f FlagDetail) GetValue() interface{}
```

GetValue returns the variant string when Variant is set; otherwise it returns Enabled.

#### `posthog.NewFlagDetail`

```go
func NewFlagDetail(key string, value interface{}, payload json.RawMessage) FlagDetail
```

NewFlagDetail creates a FlagDetail from a flag key, a bool or string value, and an optional raw JSON payload. String values are treated as enabled variants; bool values are treated as boolean flag results.

### `FlagMetadata`

```go
type FlagMetadata struct {
	// ID is the numeric feature flag ID in PostHog.
	ID int `json:"id"`
	// Version is the feature flag version evaluated by the API.
	Version int `json:"version"`
	// Payload is the raw JSON payload associated with the matched flag value.
	Payload json.RawMessage `json:"payload"`
	// Description is the feature flag description, when returned by the API.
	Description *string `json:"description,omitempty"`
	// HasExperiment reports whether the flag is linked to an experiment.
	// Nil when the server does not send it (older deployments).
	HasExperiment *bool `json:"has_experiment"`
}
```

FlagMetadata contains additional information about a flag evaluation.

### `FlagProperty`

```go
type FlagProperty struct {
	// Key is the property key to read.
	Key string `json:"key"`
	// Operator is the comparison operator, such as exact, is_not, or regex.
	Operator string `json:"operator"`
	// Value is the comparison value for Operator.
	Value interface{} `json:"value"`
	// Type is the property source. Supported values include "person", "group", "cohort", and "flag".
	Type string `json:"type"`
	// Negation inverts the property match when true.
	Negation bool `json:"negation"`
	// DependencyChain tracks feature flag dependencies while evaluating nested flag properties.
	DependencyChain []string `json:"dependency_chain"`
}
```

FlagProperty describes one property matcher in a feature flag or cohort condition.

### `FlagReason`

```go
type FlagReason struct {
	// Code is the machine-readable reason code returned by the API.
	Code string `json:"code"`
	// Description is the human-readable reason returned by the API.
	Description string `json:"description"`
	// ConditionIndex is the matched condition index, when available.
	ConditionIndex *int `json:"condition_index"`
}
```

FlagReason represents why a flag was enabled or disabled.

### `FlagVariant`

```go
type FlagVariant struct {
	// Key is the stable variant key returned by flag evaluation.
	Key string `json:"key"`
	// Name is the display name for the variant.
	Name string `json:"name"`
	// RolloutPercentage is the percentage allocated to this variant.
	RolloutPercentage *float64 `json:"rollout_percentage"`
}
```

FlagVariant describes one multivariate feature flag variant.

### `FlagVariantMeta`

```go
type FlagVariantMeta struct {
	// ValueMin is the inclusive lower bound of the normalized hash range.
	ValueMin float64
	// ValueMax is the exclusive upper bound of the normalized hash range.
	ValueMax float64
	// Key is the variant key for this hash range.
	Key string
}
```

FlagVariantMeta is a precomputed hash range for a feature flag variant.

### `FlagsRequestData`

```go
type FlagsRequestData struct {
	// ApiKey is the PostHog project API key.
	ApiKey string `json:"api_key"`
	// DistinctId is the user distinct ID to evaluate flags for.
	DistinctId string `json:"distinct_id"`
	// DeviceId optionally identifies the device for device-aware flag evaluation.
	DeviceId *string `json:"device_id,omitempty"`
	// Groups contains group identifiers for group-targeted flags.
	Groups Groups `json:"groups"`
	// PersonProperties overrides person properties for this evaluation.
	PersonProperties Properties `json:"person_properties"`
	// GroupProperties overrides group properties for this evaluation, keyed by group type.
	GroupProperties map[string]Properties `json:"group_properties"`
	// DisableGeoIP disables GeoIP enrichment for this flags request.
	DisableGeoIP bool `json:"geoip_disable,omitempty"`
	// FlagKeysToEvaluate asks the server to evaluate only these flag keys when non-empty.
	FlagKeysToEvaluate []string `json:"flag_keys_to_evaluate,omitempty"`
}
```

FlagsRequestData is the wire-format request body sent to the /flags endpoint.

### `FlagsResponse`

```go
type FlagsResponse struct {
	// CommonResponseFields contains response metadata shared across formats.
	CommonResponseFields

	// Flags contains v4-format flag details keyed by flag key.
	Flags map[string]FlagDetail `json:"flags,omitempty"`

	// FeatureFlags contains legacy v3 flag values keyed by flag key.
	FeatureFlags map[string]interface{} `json:"featureFlags"`
	// FeatureFlagPayloads contains legacy v3 raw payloads keyed by flag key.
	FeatureFlagPayloads map[string]json.RawMessage `json:"featureFlagPayloads"`
}
```

FlagsResponse represents a normalized /flags response. It accepts both legacy v3 and current v4 response shapes.

#### `FlagsResponse.UnmarshalJSON`

```go
func (r *FlagsResponse) UnmarshalJSON(data []byte) error
```

UnmarshalJSON implements custom unmarshaling to handle both v3 and v4 formats

### `GroupIdentifyInApi`

```go
type GroupIdentifyInApi struct {
	// Uuid is the valid event UUID sent to the batch API.
	Uuid string `json:"uuid"`
	// Library is the $lib the event is stored with.
	Library string `json:"library"`
	// LibraryVersion is the $lib_version the event is stored with.
	LibraryVersion string `json:"library_version"`
	// Timestamp is the event timestamp sent to the batch API in UTC.
	Timestamp time.Time `json:"timestamp"`

	// Event is always $groupidentify for GroupIdentify messages.
	Event string `json:"event"`
	// DistinctId is the distinct ID the event is sent under.
	DistinctId string `json:"distinct_id"`
	// Properties contains SDK metadata, group identifiers, and $group_set properties.
	Properties Properties `json:"properties"`
}
```

GroupIdentifyInApi is the wire-format payload produced from a GroupIdentify message.

### `Groups`

```go
type Groups map[string]string
```

Groups maps a group type, such as "company", to the key of the group an event or flag evaluation belongs to, such as "acme-inc". Convert a numeric group ID to its decimal string, for example with strconv.FormatInt, which buckets it for feature flags exactly as the number did.

#### `Groups.Set`

```go
func (p Groups) Set(name string, value string) Groups
```

Set assigns a group type to a group key and returns the receiver.

#### `posthog.NewGroups`

```go
func NewGroups() Groups
```

NewGroups creates an empty Groups map for fluent construction.

### `Holdout`

```go
type Holdout struct {
	// ID identifies the holdout. It is rendered into the synthetic variant key.
	ID interface{} `json:"id"`
	// ExclusionPercentage is the share of identifiers held out, from 0 to 100.
	ExclusionPercentage *float64 `json:"exclusion_percentage"`
}
```

Holdout is the experiment holdout configuration attached to a feature flag. Identifiers inside the holdout are excluded from the flag's release conditions and resolve to the synthetic variant "holdout-&lt;id>".

### `IdentifyInApi`

```go
type IdentifyInApi struct {
	// Type is the legacy message type sent to the batch API.
	// Deprecated: this field is ignored by PostHog ingestion and is kept for backwards compatibility.
	Type string `json:"type"`
	// Uuid is the valid event UUID sent to the batch API.
	Uuid string `json:"uuid"`
	// Library is the $lib the event is stored with.
	Library string `json:"library"`
	// LibraryVersion is the $lib_version the event is stored with.
	LibraryVersion string `json:"library_version"`
	// Timestamp is the event timestamp sent to the batch API in UTC.
	Timestamp time.Time `json:"timestamp"`

	// Event is always $identify for Identify messages.
	Event string `json:"event"`
	// DistinctId is the user distinct ID sent to PostHog.
	DistinctId string `json:"distinct_id"`
	// Properties contains SDK metadata and system context.
	Properties Properties `json:"properties"`
	// Set contains the person properties to update.
	Set Properties `json:"$set"`
}
```

IdentifyInApi is the wire-format payload produced from an Identify message.

### `InAppDecider`

```go
type InAppDecider func(frame runtime.Frame) bool
```

InAppDecider reports whether a stack frame should be considered “in-app” (i.e., part of the calling application’s own code) as opposed to external dependencies, standard library, or tooling internals. The UI can use this signal to visually emphasize frames that are likely actionable.

### `InconclusiveMatchError`

```go
type InconclusiveMatchError struct {
	// Reason is why local evaluation could not resolve the flag.
	Reason UnresolvedFlagReason
}
```

InconclusiveMatchError indicates that local evaluation could not conclusively match a condition.

#### `InconclusiveMatchError.Error`

```go
func (e *InconclusiveMatchError) Error() string
```

Error returns the inconclusive match message.

### `Logger`

```go
type Logger interface {
	// Debugf is called by PostHog client to log debug messages about the
	// operations they perform. Messages logged by this method are usually
	// tagged with an `DEBUG` log level in common logging libraries.
	Debugf(format string, args ...interface{})

	// Logf is called by PostHog client to log regular messages about the
	// operations they perform. Messages logged by this method are usually
	// tagged with an `INFO` log level in common logging libraries.
	Logf(format string, args ...interface{})

	// Warnf is called by PostHog client to log warning messages about
	// the operations they perform. Messages logged by this method are usually
	// tagged with an `WARN` log level in common logging libraries.
	Warnf(format string, args ...interface{})

	// Errorf is called by PostHog clients call this method to log errors
	// they encounter while sending events to the backend servers.
	// Messages logged by this method are usually tagged with an `ERROR` log
	// level in common logging libraries.
	Errorf(format string, args ...interface{})
}
```

Logger defines the logging interface used by PostHog clients.

#### `posthog.StdLogger`

```go
func StdLogger(logger *log.Logger, verbose bool) Logger
```

StdLogger wraps a standard log.Logger as a PostHog Logger. The verbose parameter controls whether Debugf messages are emitted.

### `Message`

```go
type Message interface {
	// Validate checks the internal structure of the message. It returns nil when
	// the message is valid or an error describing the invalid field.
	Validate() error
	// APIfy converts the message into its PostHog batch API representation.
	APIfy() APIMessage
}
```

Message represents a PostHog object that can be queued with Client.Enqueue.

Built-in message types such as Capture, Identify, Alias, GroupIdentify, and Exception implement this interface. The unexported internal method prevents external packages from defining arbitrary message implementations.

### `Options`

```go
type Options map[string]interface{}
```

Options holds per-event capture options, such as person profile processing. They are sent in the event's options object, next to its properties, on both Enqueue and EnqueueAI.

Keys are strings and values are any JSON-serializable value. The SDK sends them unchanged, so an option that PostHog adds later needs no SDK upgrade. PostHog validates them: it ignores unknown keys, reads common forms of a known key's value (for a boolean, "yes", "off" or 0), and drops the event when a known key has a value it cannot read. That drop reaches Callback.Failure as a \*CaptureEventError whose Details is "invalid\_options".

The options PostHog reads:

```text
process_person_profile   boolean
cookieless_mode          boolean
disable_skew_correction  boolean
product_tour_id          string
```

The legacy properties $process\_person\_profile, $cookieless\_mode, $ignore\_sent\_at and $product\_tour\_id still work, but an option overrides its legacy property. Use options.

An identify-style event ($identify, $create\_alias, $merge\_dangerously, $groupidentify, $set or $set\_once, sent by Identify, Alias, GroupIdentify or Capture) takes process\_person\_profile from the call alone: the option, else the legacy property, else true. No default or request-context value reaches it, because with person processing off PostHog drops these events or ignores their person update. A Capture whose distinct ID the SDK generates keeps the personless false instead of true. BeforeSend sees the value and can change it.

```go
posthog.Capture{
	DistinctId: "0123456789",
	Event:      "order completed",
	Options:    posthog.NewOptions().Set("process_person_profile", false),
}
```

#### `Options.Set`

```go
func (o Options) Set(name string, value interface{}) Options
```

Set assigns an option value and returns the receiver.

#### `posthog.NewOptions`

```go
func NewOptions() Options
```

NewOptions creates an empty Options map for fluent construction.

### `Properties`

```go
type Properties map[string]interface{}
```

Properties is used to represent properties in messages that support it. It is a free-form object so the application can set any value it sees fit but a few helper method are defined to make it easier to instantiate properties with common fields. Here's a quick example of how this type is meant to be used:

```go
posthog.Capture{
	DistinctId: "0123456789",
	Event:      "order completed",
	Properties: posthog.NewProperties().
		Set("revenue", 10.0).
		Set("currency", "USD"),
}
```

#### `Properties.Merge`

```go
func (p Properties) Merge(props Properties) Properties
```

Merge adds the properties from the provided `props` into the receiver `p`. If a property in `props` already exists in `p`, its value will be overwritten.

#### `Properties.Set`

```go
func (p Properties) Set(name string, value interface{}) Properties
```

Set assigns a property value and returns the receiver.

#### `posthog.NewProperties`

```go
func NewProperties() Properties
```

NewProperties creates an empty Properties map for fluent construction.

#### `posthog.SlogAttrsAsProperties`

```go
func SlogAttrsAsProperties(_ context.Context, r slog.Record) Properties
```

SlogAttrsAsProperties is a convenience implementation of the fn passed to WithPropertiesFn. It copies every slog.Record attribute into a Properties map, so log fields flow onto the captured exception event verbatim.

Usage: posthog.WithPropertiesFn(posthog.SlogAttrsAsProperties)

Note: this ships all attrs to PostHog — make sure none contain sensitive data, or write a filtering fn instead.

### `PropertyGroup`

```go
type PropertyGroup struct {
	// Type is the boolean operator joining Values, such as AND or OR.
	Type string `json:"type"`
	// Values contains nested PropertyGroup values or FlagProperty values.
	Values []any `json:"values"`
	// ParsedValues holds pre-parsed typed values from Values.
	// Built once at flag load time to avoid reconstructing FlagProperty/PropertyGroup
	// from map[string]any on every cohort evaluation.
	ParsedValues []parsedPropertyValue `json:"-"`
}
```

PropertyGroup describes a nested property group used by cohorts and flag conditions.

### `RequestContext`

```go
type RequestContext struct {
	// DistinctId is the request-scoped user distinct ID. It fills a missing
	// DistinctId on Capture, Exception and GroupIdentify events. It never changes
	// the ids of an Identify or an Alias.
	DistinctId string
	// SessionId is the request-scoped PostHog session ID. It is set as the
	// $session_id property of every event except GroupIdentify before
	// BeforeSend, unless the event has its own. A $session_id in Properties
	// wins over it.
	SessionId string
	// Properties are request-scoped properties for every event type.
	// They fill in before BeforeSend, only for keys the event left unset, so
	// BeforeSend sees them and can change or remove them. They win over
	// Config.DefaultEventProperties.
	Properties Properties
	// Options are request-scoped capture options for every event type.
	// They fill in before BeforeSend, only for options the event left missing or
	// nil, so BeforeSend sees them and can change them. They win over
	// Config.DefaultEventOptions. They never set process_person_profile on an
	// identify-style event; see Options.
	Options Options
}
```

RequestContext carries request-scoped PostHog metadata that is applied to events enqueued with EnqueueWithContext.

DistinctId and SessionId usually come from PostHog tracing headers (see WithCaptureTracingHeaders). Properties usually contain safe request metadata such as $current\_url, $request\_method, $request\_path, $user\_agent, and $ip.

#### `posthog.ExtractRequestContext`

```go
func ExtractRequestContext(r *http.Request, captureTracingHeaders bool) RequestContext
```

ExtractRequestContext extracts sanitized PostHog request context from an HTTP request. Request metadata is always extracted. Tracing headers are only read when captureTracingHeaders is true.

#### `posthog.RequestContextFromContext`

```go
func RequestContextFromContext(ctx context.Context) (RequestContext, bool)
```

RequestContextFromContext returns the PostHog request metadata attached to ctx, if any.

### `RequestContextOption`

```go
type RequestContextOption func(*RequestContextOptions)
```

RequestContextOption customizes request context middleware.

#### `posthog.WithCapturePanics`

```go
func WithCapturePanics(client EnqueueClient) RequestContextOption
```

WithCapturePanics configures request context middleware to capture downstream panics as PostHog exception events using client, then re-panic with the original value.

#### `posthog.WithCaptureTracingHeaders`

```go
func WithCaptureTracingHeaders(enabled bool) RequestContextOption
```

WithCaptureTracingHeaders configures whether request context middleware reads PostHog tracing headers.

### `RequestContextOptions`

```go
type RequestContextOptions struct {
	// CaptureTracingHeaders controls whether X-PostHog-Distinct-Id and X-PostHog-Session-Id
	// are read into request-scoped analytics context. It defaults to true in NewRequestContextMiddleware.
	// Any client can set these headers, so they only fill a missing distinct ID or session ID and must
	// never be used for authentication. When disabled, the middleware still attaches request metadata
	// to the request context.
	CaptureTracingHeaders bool

	// CapturePanics controls whether NewRequestContextMiddleware captures downstream panics as
	// PostHog exception events before re-panicking. It defaults to false.
	CapturePanics bool

	// PanicCaptureClient receives panic exception events when CapturePanics is enabled.
	PanicCaptureClient EnqueueClient
}
```

RequestContextOptions configures NewRequestContextMiddleware.

### `RequiresServerEvaluationError`

```go
type RequiresServerEvaluationError struct {
	// Reason is why local evaluation could not resolve the flag.
	Reason UnresolvedFlagReason
}
```

RequiresServerEvaluationError is returned when feature flag evaluation requires server-side data that is not available locally (e.g., static cohorts, experience continuity). This error should propagate immediately to trigger API fallback, unlike InconclusiveMatchError which allows trying other conditions.

#### `RequiresServerEvaluationError.Error`

```go
func (e *RequiresServerEvaluationError) Error() string
```

Error returns the reason server-side evaluation is required.

### `SendEmailResult`

```go
type SendEmailResult struct {
	// ID is the queued email's message ID.
	ID string
	// Replayed is true when PostHog had already accepted this idempotency key
	// and returned the first send's result.
	Replayed bool
	// Warnings are logged through Config.Logger as well.
	Warnings []EmailWarning
}
```

SendEmailResult is an email that PostHog queued.

### `SendFeatureFlagsBool`

```go
type SendFeatureFlagsBool bool
```

SendFeatureFlagsBool wraps a boolean value to implement SendFeatureFlagsValue.

#### `SendFeatureFlagsBool.GetOptions`

```go
func (b SendFeatureFlagsBool) GetOptions() *SendFeatureFlagsOptions
```

GetOptions returns nil because SendFeatureFlagsBool has no additional options.

#### `SendFeatureFlagsBool.ShouldSend`

```go
func (b SendFeatureFlagsBool) ShouldSend() bool
```

ShouldSend reports the wrapped boolean value.

### `SendFeatureFlagsOptions`

```go
type SendFeatureFlagsOptions struct {
	// OnlyEvaluateLocally forces evaluation to use locally loaded flag definitions only.
	OnlyEvaluateLocally bool
	// DeviceId provides a device_id for remote flag evaluation requests.
	DeviceId *string
	// PersonProperties provides explicit person properties for flag evaluation.
	PersonProperties Properties
	// GroupProperties provides explicit group properties for flag evaluation.
	GroupProperties map[string]Properties
}
```

SendFeatureFlagsOptions allows granular control over legacy feature flag evaluation for Capture. Deprecated: Prefer Client.EvaluateFlags and Capture.Flags so captures use the exact flag snapshot your application branched on without another /flags request.

#### `SendFeatureFlagsOptions.GetOptions`

```go
func (opts *SendFeatureFlagsOptions) GetOptions() *SendFeatureFlagsOptions
```

GetOptions returns opts so Capture can pass the options to feature flag evaluation.

#### `SendFeatureFlagsOptions.ShouldSend`

```go
func (opts *SendFeatureFlagsOptions) ShouldSend() bool
```

ShouldSend reports true when opts is non-nil.

### `SendFeatureFlagsValue`

```go
type SendFeatureFlagsValue interface {
	// ShouldSend reports whether Enqueue should attach feature flag values to the Capture event.
	ShouldSend() bool
	// GetOptions returns optional feature flag evaluation parameters, or nil for boolean-only values.
	GetOptions() *SendFeatureFlagsOptions
}
```

SendFeatureFlagsValue defines the legacy Capture.SendFeatureFlags configuration interface.

#### `posthog.SendFeatureFlags`

```go
func SendFeatureFlags(enabled bool) SendFeatureFlagsValue
```

SendFeatureFlags converts enabled into a legacy Capture.SendFeatureFlags value. Deprecated: Prefer Client.EvaluateFlags and Capture.Flags.

#### `posthog.SendFeatureFlagsWithOptions`

```go
func SendFeatureFlagsWithOptions(opts *SendFeatureFlagsOptions) SendFeatureFlagsValue
```

SendFeatureFlagsWithOptions wraps legacy feature flag capture options. Deprecated: Prefer Client.EvaluateFlags and Capture.Flags.

### `SlogCaptureHandler`

```go
type SlogCaptureHandler struct {
	// contains filtered or unexported fields
}
```

SlogCaptureHandler wraps a slog.Handler and mirrors qualifying records to PostHog error tracking using client.Enqueue(Exception{...}).

#### `SlogCaptureHandler.Enabled`

```go
func (h *SlogCaptureHandler) Enabled(ctx context.Context, level slog.Level) bool
```

Enabled reports whether either the wrapped handler or PostHog capture wants records at level.

#### `SlogCaptureHandler.Handle`

```go
func (h *SlogCaptureHandler) Handle(ctx context.Context, r slog.Record) error
```

Handle forwards the record to the wrapped handler and captures qualifying records as exceptions. Enqueue errors are ignored so logging remains non-intrusive.

#### `SlogCaptureHandler.WithAttrs`

```go
func (h *SlogCaptureHandler) WithAttrs(attrs []slog.Attr) slog.Handler
```

WithAttrs returns a handler with attrs applied to the wrapped handler.

#### `SlogCaptureHandler.WithGroup`

```go
func (h *SlogCaptureHandler) WithGroup(name string) slog.Handler
```

WithGroup returns a handler with name applied to the wrapped handler's group.

### `SlogOption`

```go
type SlogOption func(*captureConfig)
```

SlogOption customizes NewSlogCaptureHandler.

#### `posthog.WithDescriptionExtractor`

```go
func WithDescriptionExtractor(extractor DescriptionExtractor) SlogOption
```

WithDescriptionExtractor sets the DescriptionExtractor used for captured exceptions. The extractor parameter must be non-nil.

#### `posthog.WithDistinctIDFn`

```go
func WithDistinctIDFn(fn func(ctx context.Context, r slog.Record) string) SlogOption
```

WithDistinctIDFn sets the function used to resolve the exception DistinctId. The fn parameter must be non-nil. If fn returns an empty string, the slog record is not captured.

#### `posthog.WithFingerprintFn`

```go
func WithFingerprintFn(fn func(ctx context.Context, r slog.Record) *string) SlogOption
```

WithFingerprintFn sets the function used to compute an optional exception fingerprint. The fn parameter must be non-nil.

#### `posthog.WithMinCaptureLevel`

```go
func WithMinCaptureLevel(l slog.Level) SlogOption
```

WithMinCaptureLevel sets the minimum slog level captured as a PostHog exception. Records below this level are still passed to the wrapped handler.

#### `posthog.WithPropertiesFn`

```go
func WithPropertiesFn(fn func(ctx context.Context, r slog.Record) Properties) SlogOption
```

WithPropertiesFn sets a function that returns custom properties for captured exceptions. Built-in exception properties take precedence if keys collide. $lib and $lib\_version are SDK defaults, so a value it returns wins.

#### `posthog.WithSkip`

```go
func WithSkip(n int) SlogOption
```

WithSkip sets how many stack frames the stack trace extractor should skip. Values less than or equal to zero are ignored.

#### `posthog.WithStackTraceExtractor`

```go
func WithStackTraceExtractor(extractor StackTraceExtractor) SlogOption
```

WithStackTraceExtractor sets the StackTraceExtractor used for captured exceptions. The extractor parameter must be non-nil.

### `StackFrame`

```go
type StackFrame struct {
	// Filename is the source file path for the frame.
	Filename string `json:"filename"`
	// LineNo is the one-based source line number.
	LineNo int `json:"lineno"`
	// Function is the fully qualified function name.
	Function string `json:"function"`
	// InApp reports whether the frame is considered application code.
	InApp bool `json:"in_app"`
	// Synthetic reports whether the frame was synthesized by instrumentation.
	Synthetic bool `json:"synthetic"`
	// Platform identifies the runtime platform; plain Go frames use "go",
	// frames with raw addresses for server-side symbolication use "native".
	Platform string `json:"platform"`
	// Lang is a display-language hint for "native" frames; Go frames use "go".
	Lang string `json:"lang,omitempty"`
	// InstructionAddr is the raw return address for the frame's physical
	// group, as hex. The server symbolicates it against uploaded debug
	// symbols.
	InstructionAddr string `json:"instruction_addr,omitempty"`
	// SymbolAddr is the start address of the enclosing function, as hex.
	SymbolAddr string `json:"symbol_addr,omitempty"`
	// ImageAddr is the load address of the image containing the instruction.
	ImageAddr string `json:"image_addr,omitempty"`
	// ClientResolved reports that Function, Filename, and LineNo were
	// resolved in-process from the Go runtime's symbol table.
	ClientResolved bool `json:"client_resolved,omitempty"`
	// Inline marks a frame the runtime synthesized for a call inlined into
	// the preceding physical frame, which carries the same InstructionAddr.
	// The server resolves the group's address once and either replaces the
	// whole group with its own expansion or keeps the client frames verbatim.
	Inline bool `json:"inline,omitempty"`
}
```

StackFrame represents a single "Frame" within a stack trace. Documentation about the available fields can be found here: [https://github.com/PostHog/posthog/blob/39b9326320c23acbdc6e96a8beb41b30d3c99099/rust/cymbal/src/langs/go.rs#L7](https://github.com/PostHog/posthog/blob/39b9326320c23acbdc6e96a8beb41b30d3c99099/rust/cymbal/src/langs/go.rs#L7)

### `StackTraceExtractor`

```go
type StackTraceExtractor interface {
	// GetStackTrace returns a PostHog-compatible stack trace.
	//
	// The skip parameter controls how many leading frames to omit before
	// recording. Use it to drop extractor/logging internals and start at the
	// application call site. For example, a skip of 3–5 is typically enough to
	// hide wrapper layers when called from a slog handler.
	GetStackTrace(skip int) *ExceptionStacktrace
}
```

StackTraceExtractor produces a stack trace for the current goroutine to enrich captured exceptions with call-site context.

### `TemplateEmail`

```go
type TemplateEmail struct {
	// To is one recipient email address.
	To string
	// TemplateID is the UUID of the template.
	TemplateID string
	// TemplateData fills the template's {{ variables.* }} placeholders.
	TemplateData map[string]interface{}
	// DistinctID is the recipient's distinct ID in your product. The email's
	// events go to this person. Without it, they go to a person whose distinct
	// ID is the email address.
	DistinctID string
	// IdempotencyKey is 1 to 255 visible ASCII characters. A send with a key
	// that PostHog already accepted queues nothing and returns the first send's
	// result. Without it, the client makes a UUID that covers its own retries.
	// Pass a key derived from what the email is for, such as
	// "welcome:user_123", to cover retries outside this call too.
	IdempotencyKey string
	// MaxRetries overrides Config.EmailRequestMaxRetries for this send.
	// Ptr(0) turns retries off.
	MaxRetries *int
}
```

TemplateEmail sends an email template made transactional in PostHog, by its ID. The template sets its own sender, subject and content, and follows the project's engagement setting.

### `Ticker`

```go
type Ticker struct {
	// C receives the time for each backoff tick and is closed after Stop.
	C <-chan time.Time
}
```

Ticker delivers ticks using successive durations from a Backoff.

#### `Ticker.Stop`

```go
func (t *Ticker) Stop()
```

Stop stops the ticker goroutine and closes C. Stop should be called at most once.

### `UnresolvedFlagReason`

```go
type UnresolvedFlagReason string
```

UnresolvedFlagReason explains why local evaluation could not resolve a flag. Experience continuity and unsupported definitions come from the flag's definition, missing context from the evaluation call, and unresolved dependencies from a flag the definition depends on.

```go
const (
	// UnresolvedFlagReasonExperienceContinuity means the flag has experience continuity
	// enabled, which local evaluation never resolves.
	UnresolvedFlagReasonExperienceContinuity UnresolvedFlagReason = "experience_continuity"
	// UnresolvedFlagReasonUnsupportedDefinition means the flag uses something local
	// evaluation does not support, such as a static cohort, an unknown operator, a
	// malformed value, or a missing or circular flag dependency.
	UnresolvedFlagReasonUnsupportedDefinition UnresolvedFlagReason = "unsupported_definition"
	// UnresolvedFlagReasonUnresolvedDependency means a flag this flag depends on has a
	// loaded definition but local evaluation could not resolve it.
	UnresolvedFlagReasonUnresolvedDependency UnresolvedFlagReason = "unresolved_dependency"
	// UnresolvedFlagReasonMissingContext means the call did not pass a property, group
	// property or device id the flag needs, or passed it in a form local evaluation
	// cannot use.
	UnresolvedFlagReasonMissingContext UnresolvedFlagReason = "missing_context"
)
```

### `Variants`

```go
type Variants struct {
	// Variants is the ordered list of possible flag variants.
	Variants []FlagVariant `json:"variants"`
}
```

Variants contains all variants configured for a multivariate feature flag.
