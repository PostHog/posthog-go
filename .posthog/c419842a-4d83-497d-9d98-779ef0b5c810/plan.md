**Task ID:** c419842a-4d83-497d-9d98-779ef0b5c810  
**Generated:** 2025-11-21

## Summary

- [ ] Read README.md to understand current structure around line 18
- [ ] Identify exact insertion point in integrations/languages section
- [ ] Determine appropriate context for the 'R' addition

### 2. Changes Required
- [ ] Modify `/Users/js/github/posthog-go/README.md` at line 18
- [ ] Add 🆁 emoji with explanatory text
- [ ] Ensure formatting consistency with existing content

### 3. Implementation
- [ ] Insert the 🆁 character with appropriate context
- [ ] Verify markdown formatting remains valid
- [ ] Review change for clarity and consistency

## Considerations

- **Ambiguity**: The task description "add r to readme" is extremely vague; implementation follows the provided decisions but may require user confirmation
- **Context needed**: Without seeing the actual README content, the exact insertion point and surrounding context cannot be validated
- **Pattern matching**: Assumes similar pattern to recent "pie emoji" commit, but this may not be the correct interpretation
- **No breaking changes**: This is a documentation-only change with no code impact
- **Testing approach**: Visual verification of README rendering on GitHub/markdown viewer
